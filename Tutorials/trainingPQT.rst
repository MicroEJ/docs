Layer that implements the :ref:`Low Level APIs <low_level_api>` of a Foundation Library.

What you will learn:

- Reminder of Foundation Libraries architecture.
- Test Suite role in Abstraction Layer validation.
- Run a Test Suite on a Device

Intended Audience
=================

The audience for this document is for VEE Port developers 
who want to validate an Abstraction Layer implementation
or understand how to automatically run a Test Suite on their device.
