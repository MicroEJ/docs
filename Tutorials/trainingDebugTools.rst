Description
===========

This training describes the available tools provided to developers to debug an application.
It also presents debugging methods applied to two concrete uses cases (GUI application freeze and HardFault).

Intended Audience
=================

The audience for this document is for developers who want to learn about the tools available to debug embedded applications.

In addition, the :ref:`tutorial_discover_embedded_debugging_techniques.use_case_1` is particularly relevant for Application Developers.
