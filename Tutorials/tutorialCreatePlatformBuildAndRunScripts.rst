Create MicroEJ Platform Build and Run Scripts
=============================================

This tutorial describes all the steps to create :ref:`MicroEJ Platform <platform_import>` build and run scripts and shows how to use them.

Intended Audience
-----------------

The audience for this document is Platform engineers who want to

- validate their MicroEJ Platform using automated :ref:`MicroEJ test suites <platform_testsuite>`.
- prepare their MicroEJ Platform for automated builds and continuous integration using :ref:`mmm`.
- ease :ref:`MicroEJ Standalone Application <standalone_application>` development by simplifying the Firmware build for Java developers.
- configure their MicroEJ Platform with full :ref:`BSP connection<bsp_connection>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

This tutorial is a direct continuation of :ref:`tutorial_create_firmware_from_scratch` tutorial. It should have been completed before starting this one.

Introduction
------------

Build and Run scripts are normalized entry points to

- build a MicroEJ Firmware linked to the Board Support Package,
- deploy and run the Firmware on a device.

External tools only need to run these scripts without additional knowledge about the toolchain or deployment tools.

See :ref:`bsp_connection_build_script` and :ref:`bsp_connection_run_script` sections for more information about these scripts. Script examples are provided in `Platform Qualification Tools <https://github.com/MicroEJ/PlatformQualificationTools/tree/master/framework/platform/scripts>`_ repository.

Overview
--------

In the previous :ref:`tutorial_create_firmware_from_scratch` tutorial, the final binary is produced by invoking ``make`` in the FreeRTOS BSP. The command to type is dependant of the toolchain used. The Firmware is then executed in QEMU but could have been instead flashed to a device with another specific command. This tutorial explain how to write `build` and `run` scripts for these two tasks. 

The next sections will

- describe step-by-step how to create the build and run scripts both for unix-like systems (Bash scripts) and Windows systems (batch files). These scripts automate Firmware build and execution in QEMU as presented in :ref:`tutorial_create_firmware_from_scratch` tutorial.
- show a practical usage of these scripts in a MicroEJ development flow. This will allow to configure a MicroEJ Standalone Application to build the Firmware in MicroEJ SDK.

Finally, this tutorial describes how to convert the MicroEJ Platform from partial BSP connection to full BSP connection.

Create Build and Run Scripts
----------------------------

This section describes how to write build and run scripts.

There are two scripts:

#. ``build.[sh|bat]`` which calls the C toolchain to build and link the Firmware file. It also ensures that the output file is called ``application.out`` and is located in the directory from where the script was called.
#. ``run.[sh|bat]`` which deploys and runs ``application.out`` on the device. In this tutorial, it will only run the Firmware with QEMU instead of flashing it on real hardware.

Each of these scripts come in two flavors: ``.sh`` for unix-like systems, and ``.bat`` for Windows systems.

First, create a ``microej/scripts`` directory in BSP project:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ pwd
  /mnt/c/Users/user/src/tuto-from-scratch/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC
  $ mkdir microej/scripts

.. note::
  
   The scripts created in the next sections will be put in this directory.

Create `build.sh` and `run.sh` Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

  Make sure the build and run scripts have the execution permission.

1. Create a file called ``build.sh`` in the ``microej/scripts`` directory with the following content:

  .. code-block:: shell

    #!/bin/bash

    # Save application current directory and jump one level above scripts
    CURRENT_DIRECTORY=$(pwd)
 
    # Move to the directory where the Makefile is
    cd $(dirname "$0")/../..

    # Build the firmware
    make

    # Copy output the the current directory while renaming it
    cp gcc/RTOSDemo.bin  $CURRENT_DIRECTORY/application.out

    # Restore application directory
    cd $CURRENT_DIRECTORY/

2. Verify that the script successfully built your Firmware and put it in the current directory with the name ``application.out``.

  .. code-block:: shell

    $ pwd
    /mnt/c/Users/user/src/tuto-from-scratch/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC
    $ make clean
    $ microej/scripts/build.sh
      CC    init/startup.c
      CC    main.c
      CC    ../../Source/list.c
      CC    ../../Source/queue.c
      CC    ../../Source/tasks.c
    [..]
      130 |  __attribute__( ( always_inline ) ) static inline uint8_t ucPortCountLeadingZeros( uint32_t ulBitmap )
          |                                                           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      LD    gcc/RTOSDemo.axf
    $ ls *.out
    application.out

3. Check that ``application.out`` successfully runs with QEMU:

  .. code-block:: shell

    $ qemu-system-arm -M lm3s6965evb -nographic -kernel application.out
    Hello, World! printf function is working.
    Hello World!
    QEMU: Terminated // press Ctrl-a x to end the QEMU session

4. Create a file called ``run.sh`` in the ``microej/scripts`` directory with the following content:

  .. code-block:: shell

    #!/bin/bash

    # Add some text to the console before launch
    echo -e "\033[0;32m## Start application in QEMU."
    echo -e "## Use 'Ctrl-a x' to quit.\e[0m"

    # Launch application with QEMU
    qemu-system-arm -M lm3s6965evb -nographic -kernel application.out

5. We can now run the Firmware we just built with the ``run.sh`` script:

  .. code-block:: shell

    $ pwd
    /mnt/c/Users/user/src/tuto-from-scratch/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC
    $ microej/scripts/run.sh
    ## Start application in QEMU.
    ## Use 'Ctrl-a x' to quit.
    Hello, World! printf function is working.
    Hello World!

.. note::

  This script is very simple because our Firmware is just run with QEMU instead of real hardware. To deploy the Firmware on a device, the script would have to setup and call a flash tool. See for instance the build and run scripts for `Espressif-ESP-WROVER-KIT-V4.1 <https://github.com/MicroEJ/Platform-Espressif-ESP-WROVER-KIT-V4.1/blob/1.7.0/ESP32-WROVER-Xtensa-FreeRTOS-bsp/Projects/microej/scripts/build.sh>`_. 

Create `build.bat` and `run.bat` Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As our toolchain has only be configured for Linux in WSL, we create wrappers that call shell scripts through WSL.
We could also decide to directly invoke QEMU for Windows instead. This is just a implementation choice for this Platform.

1. Create a file called ``build.bat`` in the ``microej/scripts`` directory with the following content:

  .. code-block:: batch

    @echo off
    SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS

    REM Reset ERRORLEVEL between multiple run in the same shell
    SET ERRORLEVEL=0

    REM Save application current directory and jump to scripts directory
    SET CURRENT_DIRECTORY=%CD%
    CD "%~dp0"

    REM Get the script directory in a Unix path format
    FOR /F %%i in ('WSL pwd') DO SET SCRIPT_DIRECTORY=%%i

    REM Restore application directory
    CD %CURRENT_DIRECTORY%

    REM Run the bash build script with WSL
    WSL %SCRIPT_DIRECTORY%/build.sh

    IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
  	  EXIT /B %ERRORLEVEL%
    )

2. Calling this script in PowerShell should produce the following result:

  .. code-block:: shell

    PS C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC> microej\scripts\build.bat
      CC    init/startup.c
      CC    main.c
      CC    ../../Source/list.c
      CC    ../../Source/queue.c
      CC    ../../Source/tasks.c
     [...]
      CC    microej/src/LLMJVM_stub.c
      LD    gcc/RTOSDemo.axf
    Current DIR /mnt/c/Users/user/src/tuto-from-scratch/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC/microej/scripts
            1 file(s) moved.

.. note::

  This prints the full build output if it is the first build (or after a ``make clean``) otherwise it prints ``make: Nothing to be done for 'all'``.

3. Create a file called ``run.bat`` in the ``microej/scripts`` directory with the following content:

  .. code-block:: batch

    @echo off
    SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS

    REM Reset ERRORLEVEL between multiple run in the same shell
    SET ERRORLEVEL=0

    REM Save application current directory and jump to scripts directory
    SET CURRENT_DIRECTORY=%CD%
    CD "%~dp0"

    REM Get the script directory in a Unix path format
    FOR /F %%i in ('WSL pwd') DO SET SCRIPT_DIRECTORY=%%i

    REM Restore application directory
    CD %CURRENT_DIRECTORY%

    REM Run the bash run script with WSL
    WSL %SCRIPT_DIRECTORY%/run.sh

    IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    	EXIT /B %ERRORLEVEL%
    )

4. Calling this script in PowerShell should produce the following result:

  .. code-block:: shell

    C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC\application.out
    1 file(s) copied.
    ## Start application in QEMU.
    ## Use 'Ctrl-a x' to quit.
    Hello, World! printf function is working.
    Hello World!

Use Build Script in MicroEJ SDK
-------------------------------

In this section, we illustrate how build script is used in practice to ease the Firmware build for Java developers in MicroEJ SDK.

We will configure a MicroEJ Standalone Application to enable full Firmware build (application + BSP + link) when building the `HelloWorld` application.

We will then configure a full BSP connection. This will remove the need to configure the path of the BSP root directory as a MicroEJ Standalone Application option.
Please refer to :ref:`BSP connection cases <bsp_connection_cases>` section and :ref:`BSP connection options <bsp_connection_options>` for more details.

.. note::

    Build and run scripts do not require to configure a full BSP connection. This last part has only be added to allow a MicroEJ Standalone Application project to be built independently from the BSP.

Build Firmware from MicroEJ SDK 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Right click on the ``HelloWorld`` application project
2. In the menu, select :guilabel:`Run As` > :guilabel:`Run Configurations...`
3. Select the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab
4. Select :guilabel:`Device` > :guilabel:`Deploy` entry in the configurations menu
5. Check :guilabel:`Execute the MicroEJ script (build.bat) at the location known by the 3rd-party BSP project` checkbox

  .. image::  images/configure_build_bat_eclipse.png
     :scale: 80 %

6. Click on the :guilabel:`Run` button. It should print the following:

  .. code-block:: none

    =============== [ Initialization Stage ] ===============
    Platform connected to BSP location 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC' using application option 'deploy.bsp.root.dir'.

    The following error occurred while executing this line:
    C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\workspace\lm3s811evb-Platform-CM0_GCC48-0.0.1\source\scripts\deploy.xml:30: The following error occurred while executing this line:

Either update the Platform configuration (option 'deploy.bsp.microejscript.relative.dir' in 'bsp/bsp.properties') or disable this option.

7. Edit the file ``bsp/bsp.properties`` as follow:

  .. code-block:: properties

    # Specify BSP external scripts files ('build.bat' and 'run.bat') parent directory.
    # This is a '/' separated directory relative to 'bsp.root.dir'.
    microejscript.relative.dir=microej/scripts

8. Rebuild your Platform (right-click on the platform configuration project and click on :guilabel:`Build Module`)
9. Run the `HelloWorld` launcher once again. This should print the following result:

  .. code-block:: none

    =============== [ Initialization Stage ] ===============
    Platform connected to BSP location 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC' using platform option 'deploy.bsp.root.dir'.

    =============== [ Completed Successfully ] ===============

    SUCCESS

Reading the traces, we see that the `HelloWorld` application (`microejapp.o`) and the MicroEJ Platform library (`microejruntime.a`) have been deployed to the suitable BSP location.
Then the ``build.bat`` script has been executed to rebuild the BSP and link the Firmware. The output is the ``application.out`` binary that can be flashed on the device (or run on QEMU).

.. _convert_partial_to_full_bsp_connection:

Convert from partial BSP connection to full BSP connection (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we configure the BSP root directory in the Platform. 
Such configuration is called `full BSP connection`: the MicroEJ Platform includes the BSP, and any MicroEJ Standalone Application can be built against this MicroEJ Platform without extra configuration.

When launching the ``HelloWorld`` application from MicroEJ SDK, the launcher knows how to find the BSP because we have configured its path in ``HelloWorld/build/emb.properties`` file which is imported in the launcher
(this file has been configured in :ref:`tutorial_create_firmware_from_scratch` tutorial).

1. Cut ``deploy.bsp.root.dir`` property value from ``HelloWorld/build/emb.properties`` file
2. Paste the value in ``bsp/bsp.properties`` as follow:

  .. code-block:: properties

    # Specify the BSP root directory. Can use ${project.parent.dir} which target the parent of platform configuration project
    # For example, '${workspace}/${project.prefix}-bsp' specifies a BSP project beside the '-configuration' project
    root.dir=[absolute_path] to FreeRTOS\\FreeRTOS\\Demo\\CORTEX_LM3S811_GCC

3. Rebuild your MicroEJ Platform (right-click on the platform configuration project and click on :guilabel:`Build Module`)

   The MicroEJ Platform is now fully connected to the BSP.
  
4. Launch ``HelloWorld`` project from Eclipse launcher, it should print the following result:

  .. code-block:: none

    =============== [ Initialization Stage ] ===============
    Platform connected to BSP location 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC' using platform option 'root.dir' in 'bsp/bsp.properties'.
    [INFO ] Launching in Evaluation mode. Your UID is 0120202834374C4A.
    =============== [ Launching SOAR ] ===============
    =============== [ Launching Link ] ===============
    =============== [ Deployment ] ===============
    MicroEJ files for the 3rd-party BSP project are generated to 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\workspace\HelloWorld\com.mycompany.Main\platform'.
    The MicroEJ application (microejapp.o) has been deployed to: 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC\microej\lib'.
    The MicroEJ platform library (microejruntime.a) has been deployed to: 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC\microej\lib'.
    The MicroEJ platform header files (*.h) have been deployed to: 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC\microej\inc'.
    Execution of script 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC\microej\scripts\build.bat' started...
      LD    gcc/RTOSDemo.axf
    Current DIR /mnt/c/Users/user/src/tuto-from-scratch/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/CORTEX_LM3S6965_GCC/microej/scripts
    Execution of script 'C:\Users\user\src\tuto-from-scratch\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOS\Demo\CORTEX_LM3S6965_GC  C\microej\scripts\build.bat' done.
    =============== [ Completed Successfully ] ===============

    SUCCESS

  .. note::

    You can notice the difference in the second line of the trace that now says that the connection is ``using platform option root.dir' in 'bsp/bsp.properties'`` instead of ``using platform option 'deploy.bsp.root.dir'`` in the previous launch.

 The application launcher does not know anymore where the BSP is located. Nevertheless it still builds a Firmware ready to be flashed.
 The link to the BSP is now configured in the MicroEJ Platform. Any MicroEJ Standalone Application can be built against this MicroEJ Platform with no BSP specific option.
