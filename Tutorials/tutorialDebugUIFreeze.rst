Debug a “UI Freeze”
========================

When an application User Interface freezes and becomes unresponsive, in most cases, one of the following conditions applies: 

- An unrecoverable system failure occurred, like a HardFault, and the RTOS tasks are not scheduled anymore. 
- The RTOS task that runs the MicroEJ runtime is never given CPU time (suspended or blocked). 
- The RTOS task that runs the MicroEJ runtime is executing never-ending native code (infinite loop in native implementation for example). 
- A Java method is executing a long running operation in the MicroUI Display Pump thread. 
- The application code is unable to receive or process user input events.

This tutorial explains how to instrument the code in order to locate the issue when the UI freeze occurs.

Bottom-Up approach
------------------

Let’s start at low level by figuring out if the RTOS is scheduling the
tasks correctly. Make one of the RTOS task act like a heart beat: create
a dedicated task and make it report in some way at a regular pace (print
a message on standard output, blink a LED, etc.). If the heart beat is
still running when the UI freeze occurs, we can go a step further and
check whether the MicroEJ runtime is still scheduling Java threads or
not.

As a reminder, the architecture of the MicroEJ runtime is called green
thread architecture, it defines a multi-threaded environment without
relying on any native RTOS capabilities. Therefore, the whole Java world
runs in one single RTOS task. Read more about this architecture in the
`Platform Developer
Guide <https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/PlatformDeveloperGuide/coreEngine.html>`__.
(QUESTION: use architecture diagram from plaftorm guide?) A quick way to
check if the Java threads are scheduled correctly is, here again, to
make one of the threads print a heart beat message. Copy/paste the
following snippet in the ``main()`` method of the application:

::

   TimerTask task = new TimerTask() {

       @Override
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Alive");
       }
   };
   Timer timer = new Timer();
   timer.schedule(task, 10_000, 10_000);

This code creates a new Java thread that will print the message “Alive”
on the standard output every 10 seconds. If the “Alive” printouts stop
when the UI freeze occurs (assuming no one cancelled the ``Timer``),
then it means that the MicroEJ Runtime stopped scheduling the Java
threads. Few suggestions:

-  The RTOS task that runs the MicroEJ runtime might be suspended or
   blocked. Check if some API call is suspending the task or if a shared
   resource could be blocking it.

-  When a Java native method executes, it executes its C counterpart
   function in the RTOS task that runs the MicroEJ runtime. While the C
   function executes, no other Java methods executes: the Java world
   “waits” for the C function to finish. As a consequence, if the C
   function never returns, no Java thread can run. Spot any suspect
   native functions and print every entry/exit to detect faulty code.

Now, what if the “Alive” heart beat runs while the UI is frozen? Java
threads are getting scheduled but the UI thread, called “Display Pump”,
does not process display events. Let’s make the heart beat snippet above
execute in the UI thread. Simply wraps the
``System.out.println("Alive")`` with a ``callSerially``:

::

   TimerTask task = new TimerTask() {

       @Override
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("TimerTask Alive");
           Display.getDefaultDisplay().callSerially(new Runnable() {
           
               @Override
               public void run() {
                   System.out.println("UI Alive");
               }
           });
       }
       
       @Override
       public void uncaughtException(Timer timer, Throwable e) {
           // Default implementation of this method would cancel the task. 
           // Let's just ignore uncaught exceptions for debug purposes.
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
   };
   Timer timer = new Timer();
   timer.schedule(task, 10_000, 10_000);

In case this snippet prints “TimerTask Alive” but not “UI alive” when
the freeze occurs, then there are few options:

-  The application might be processing a long operation in the UI
   thread, for example:

   -  infinite/indeterminate loops
   -  network/database access
   -  heavy computations
   -  ``Thread.sleep()``/``Object.wait()``
   -  ``SNI_suspendCurrentJavaThread()`` in native call

   When doing so, any other UI-related operation will not be processed
   until completion, leading the display to being unresponsive. Any code
   that runs in the UI thread might be responsible. Look for code
   executed as a result of calls to:

   -  ``repaint()``: code in ``renderContent()``
   -  ``revalidate()``/``revalidateSubTree()``: code in
      ``validateContent()`` and ``setBoundsContent()``
   -  ``handleEvent()``
   -  ``callSerially()``: code wrapped in such calls will execute in the
      UI thread

-  The UI thread has terminated.

As a general rule, avoid running long operations in the UI thread,
follow the general pattern and use a dedicated thread/executor instead:
(QUESTION: use a sequence diagram to be more explicit?)

::

   ExecutorService executorService = ServiceLoaderFactory.getServiceLoader().getService(ExecutorService.class, SingleThreadExecutor.class);
   executorService.execute(new Runnable() {

       @Override
       public void run() {
       
           // (... long non-UI operation ...)
           
           // optional: update the UI upon completion
           Display.getDefaultDisplay().callSerially(new Runnable() {
                       
           @Override
           public void run() {
                       // update display code (will be executed in UI thread)
           }
       });
       }
   });

Another case that is worth looking at is whether the application is
processing user input events like it should. The UI may look “frozen”
only because it don’t react to input events. Replace the desktop
instance with the one below to log all user inputs.

::

   Desktop desktop = new Desktop() {

       @Override
       public EventHandler getController() {
           EventHandler controller = super.getController();
           return new EventHandler() {
           @Override
               public boolean handleEvent(int event) {
               System.out.println("Desktop.handleEvent() received event of type " + Event.getType(event));
               return controller.handleEvent(event);
               }
           };
       }
   };

LLMJVM_dump
-----------

In addition to the tips described above, the ``LLMJVM_dump`` tool will
give detailled information about the current state of Java threads when
the issue occurs:

From Platform Developer Guide: > The internal MicroEJ Core Engine
function called LLMJVM_dump allows you to dump the state of all MicroEJ
threads: name, priority, stack trace, etc. This function can be called
at any time and from an interrupt routine (for instance from a button
interrupt).
