VEE Port Creation for a Custom Device
=====================================

Description
===========

In this training, you will follow the typical steps followed by
a Firmware developer integrating MICROEJ VEE on 
a target device.

What you will learn:

- Get a running "HelloWorld" in C.
- Install a MicroEJ Architecture that matches the target device/RTOS/toolchain.
- Create a VEE Port project.
- Integrate MICROEJ VEE in the BSP / RTOS.
- Create and Run a HelloWorld Application.
- Validate the resulting VEE Port with the Port Qualification Tools (PQT).
- Create Build and Run Scripts.

No Evaluation kit is required to follow this training. Everything is emulated on the developerâ€™s PC.

Intended Audience
=================

This training is for developers wishing to familiarize themselves with the MicroEJ Development flow.

Prerequisites
=============

- Knowledge of C programming language.
- Experience in embedded software development.
