Debugging Tools
---------------

This section presents an overview of the main tools available to debug an embedded application.
Please refer to the developer guides for the complete reference (:ref:`application-developer-guide`, :ref:`platform-developer-guide`, :ref:`kernel-developer-guide`).

.. _tutorial_discover_embedded_debugging_techniques.tools.events_tracing_and_logging:

Events Tracing and Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an application has issues, the first step is to understand what is happening inside the system.

- The `Trace Library <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/trace/Tracer.html>`__ is a real-time event recording library. Use it to trace the beginning and the ending of events.

   .. code-block:: java
      :emphasize-lines: 4,9

      private static final int EVENT_ID = 0;

      public static void switchState(ApplicationState newState) {
         tracer.recordEvent(EVENT_ID);

         previousState = currentState;
         currentState = newState;

         tracer.recordEventEnd(EVENT_ID);
      }

  This API is most useful with the :ref:`SystemView Event tracer<systemview>` to visualize the timeline of events.

      :alt: SystemView analysis of DemoWidget on STM32F7508 Platform
      :align: center
      :scale: 75

- The `Message Library <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/util/message/basic/BasicMessageLogger.html>`__ is a small RAM/ROM/CPU footprint API to log errors, warnings, and misc information.

   .. code-block:: java 
      :emphasize-lines: 9

      private static final String LOG_CATEGORY = "Application";

      private static final int LOG_ID = 2;

      public static void switchState(ApplicationState newState) {
         previousState = currentState;
         currentState = newState;

         BasicMessageLogger.INSTANCE.log(Level.INFO, LOG_CATEGORY, LOG_ID, previousState, currentState);
      }     

- The `Logging Library <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/java/util/logging/Logger.html>`__ implements a subset of the standard Java ``java.util.logging``.

   .. code-block:: java
      :emphasize-lines: 5,6,7
     
      public static void switchState(ApplicationState newState) {
         previousState = currentState;
         currentState = newState;

         Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Main.class.getName());
         logger.log(Level.INFO, "The application state has changed from " + previousState.toString() + " to "
               + currentState.toString() + ".");
      }

Please refer to the tutorial :ref:`tutorial_instrument_java_code_for_logging` for a comparison of these libraries.

.. _tutorial_discover_embedded_debugging_techniques.tools.runtime_state_dump:

Runtime State Dump
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Output information on the standard output ``System.out`` and use the :ref:`stack_trace_reader` to read and decode the MicroEJ stack traces.

   :alt: Code to Dump a Stack Trace

.. |fig2| image:: ../ApplicationDeveloperGuide/images/STR_trace-read.png
   :alt: Stack Trace Reader Console

- The :ref:`Core Engine VM dump<vm_dump>` is a low-level API to display the state of the MicroEJ Runtime and the MicroEJ threads (name, priority, stack trace, etc. )

   .. code-block::

.. _tutorial_discover_embedded_debugging_techniques.tools.memory_inspection:

Memory Inspection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Memory issues such as memory corruption and memory leaks can be hard to troubleshoot.  However, the following tools are available to address these issues:

* Check the internal structure integrity of the MicroJvm virtual machine with the :ref:`LLMJVM_checkIntegrity API <core_engine.check_integrity>` to detect memory corruptions in native functions.
* Use the :ref:`Heap Usage Monitoring Tool <heap_usage_monitoring>` to estimate the heap requirements of an application.
* The :ref:`heapdumper` tools analyze the content of the heap.  They are helpful to detect memory leaks and look for optimization of the heap usage.

.. _tutorial_discover_embedded_debugging_techniques.use_case_1:

Use Case 1:  Debugging a GUI Application Freeze
-----------------------------------------------

When an application User Interface freezes and becomes unresponsive, in most cases, one of the following conditions applies:

- An unrecoverable system failure occurred, like a HardFault, and the RTOS tasks are not scheduled anymore.
- The RTOS task that runs the Core Engine is never given CPU time (suspended or blocked).
- The RTOS task that runs the Core Engine is executing never-ending native code (infinite loop in native implementation for example).
- A Java method executes a long-running operation in the MicroUI thread (also called Display Pump thread).
- The application code is unable to receive or process user input events.

The following sections explain how to instrument the code to locate the issue when the UI freeze occurs.
The steps followed are:

1. Check if the RTOS properly schedules the Core Engine task.
2. Check if the Core Engine properly schedules all Java threads.
3. Check if the Core Engine properly schedules the MicroUI thread.
4. Check if Input Events are properly processed.

.. note::
   - The checks of the schedulers are possible with :ref:`systemview` and :ref:`MicroUI Debug Traces <microui_traces>`.
   - The Input Events check is possible with the :ref:`LLUI_INPUT_dump API <section_inputs_eventbuffer>`.

Check RTOS Tasks Scheduling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's start at low level by figuring out if the RTOS is scheduling tasks correctly.
If possible, use a debugger or :ref:`systemview`; if not, use the heartbeat task described below.

Make one of the RTOS tasks acts like a heartbeat: create a dedicated
task and make it report in some way at a regular pace (print a message
on standard output, blink an LED, use SystemView, etc.).
Set the heartbeat task priority to the same priority as the Core Engine task. 

In this configuration, if the heartbeat is still running when the UI freeze occurs, we can go a step 
further and check whether the Core Engine is still scheduling Java threads or not. 
See next section :ref:`tutorial_discover_embedded_debugging_techniques.check_java_threads_scheduling`.

If the heartbeat doesn't run when the UI freeze occurs, set the heartbeat task priority to the maximum priority.

.. warning:: 
   Some RTOS use a task to schedule the RTOS timers.
   The heartbeat task priority must be lower than the RTOS timers priority.

..

In this configuration, if the heartbeat is still running when the UI freeze occurs, then an RTOS task with a 
priority higher than the Core Engine task keeps using the CPU. 
Use the RTOS specific tools to identify what is the faulty task.

If the heartbeat doesn't run when the UI freeze occurs, then the RTOS scheduler is not scheduling anything. 
This can be caused by an RTOS timer task or an interrupt handler that never returns, or a crash of the RTOS scheduler.

The following flow chart summarizes the investigation steps.



..
   @startuml
   :Create heartbeat task with priority\nset to Core Engine task priority;
   if (heartbeat task runs) then (yes)
     :Core Engine is running:\nGo to next section;
     kill
   else (no)
     :Set heartbeat task priority\nto the highest priority;
     if (Heartbeat task runs) then (yes)
       #pink:Higher priority task prevents\nCore Engine task to run;
       kill
     else (no)
       #pink:RTOS scheduler is not working;
       kill
     endif
   endif
   @enduml  

.. image:: images/tuto_microej_debug_ui_freeze_rtos_task_heart_beat_priority.png

.. _tutorial_discover_embedded_debugging_techniques.check_java_threads_scheduling:

Check Java Threads Scheduling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a reminder, the threading model implemented by Core Engine is called green thread: it defines a multi-threaded environment without relying on any native RTOS capabilities. 
Therefore, all Java threads run in a single RTOS task.
For more details, please refer to the :ref:`MicroEJ Core Engine<core_engine>` section.
A quick way to check if the Java threads are scheduled correctly is, here again, to make one of the threads print a heartbeat message. Copy/paste the following snippet in the ``main()`` method of the application:

.. code-block:: java

   TimerTask task = new TimerTask() {

       @Override
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Alive");
       }
   };
   Timer timer = new Timer();
   timer.schedule(task, 10_000, 10_000);

This code creates a new Java thread that will print the message ``Alive``
on the standard output every 10 seconds.

Assuming no one canceled the ``Timer``, if the ``Alive`` printouts stop when the UI freeze occurs, then it can mean that:

- The Core Engine stopped scheduling the Java threads.
- Or that one or more threads with a higher priority prevent the threads with a lower priority from running.

Here are a few suggestions:

- Ensure no Java threads with a high priority prevent the scheduling of the other Java threads.
  For example, convert the above example with a dedicated thread with the highest priority:

  .. code-block:: java

     Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {

     	@Override
     	public void run() {
     		while (true) {
     			try {
     				Thread.sleep(10_000);
     				System.out.println("Alive");
     			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
     				e.printStackTrace();
     			}
     		}
     	}
     });
     thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
     thread.start();

- The RTOS task that runs the Core Engine might be suspended or
  blocked. Check if some API call is suspending the task or if a
  shared resource could be blocking it.

- When a Java native method is called, it calls its C counterpart function in the RTOS task that runs the Core Engine.
  While the C function is running, no other Java methods can run because the Core Engine waits for the C function to finish.
  Consequently, no Java thread can ever run again if the C function never returns.
  Therefore, spot any suspect native functions and trace every entry/exit to detect faulty code.

Please refer to :ref:`implementation_details` if you encounter issues
when implementing the heartbeat.

Check UI Thread Liveness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, what if the ``Alive`` heartbeat runs while the UI is frozen?
Java threads are getting scheduled, but the UI thread (also called
Display Pump thread) does not process display events.

Let's make the heartbeat snippet above execute in the UI
thread. Simply wraps the ``System.out.println("Alive")`` with a
``callSerially``:

.. code-block:: java

   TimerTask task = new TimerTask() {

       @Override
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("TimerTask Alive");
           MicroUI.callSerially(new Runnable() {
           
               @Override
               public void run() {
                   System.out.println("UI Alive");
               }
           });
       }
       
       @Override
       public void uncaughtException(Timer timer, Throwable e) {
           // Default implementation of this method would cancel the task. 
           // Let's just ignore uncaught exceptions for debug purposes.
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
   };
   Timer timer = new Timer();
   timer.schedule(task, 10_000, 10_000);

In case this snippet prints ``TimerTask Alive`` but not ``UI alive`` when
the freeze occurs, then there are a few options:

-  The application might be processing a long operation in the UI
   thread, for example:

   -  infinite/indeterminate loops
   -  network/database access
   -  heavy computations
   -  ``Thread.sleep()``/``Object.wait()``
   -  ``SNI_suspendCurrentJavaThread()`` in native call

   When doing so, any other UI-related operation will not be processed
   until completion, leading the display to be unresponsive. Any code
   that runs in the UI thread might be responsible. Look for code
   executed as a result of calls to:

   -  ``repaint()``: code in ``renderContent()``
   -  ``revalidate()``/``revalidateSubTree()``: code in
      ``validateContent()`` and ``setBoundsContent()``
   -  ``handleEvent()``
   -  ``callSerially()``: code wrapped in such calls will be executed
      in the UI thread

-  The UI thread has terminated.

As a general rule, avoid running extended operations in the UI thread,
follow the general pattern and use a dedicated thread/executor instead:

.. (QUESTION: use a sequence diagram to be more explicit?)

.. code-block:: java

   ExecutorService executorService = ServiceLoaderFactory.getServiceLoader().getService(ExecutorService.class, SingleThreadExecutor.class);
   executorService.execute(new Runnable() {

       @Override
       public void run() {
       
           // (... long non-UI operation ...)
           
           // optional: update the UI upon completion
           Display.getDefaultDisplay().callSerially(new Runnable() {
                       
           @Override
           public void run() {
                       // update display code (will be executed in UI thread)
           }
       });
       }
   });

Check Input Events Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another case worth looking at is whether the application is processing user input events as it should.
The UI may look "frozen" only because it doesn't react to input events. 
Replace the desktop instance with the one below to log all user inputs.

.. code-block:: java

   Desktop desktop = new Desktop() {

       @Override
       public EventHandler getController() {
           EventHandler controller = super.getController();
           return new EventHandler() {
           @Override
               public boolean handleEvent(int event) {
               System.out.println("Desktop.handleEvent() received event of type " + Event.getType(event));
               return controller.handleEvent(event);
               }
           };
       }
   };

It is also possible to display the content of MicroUI Event Buffer with the ``LLUI_INPUT_IMPL_log_XXX`` API.
Please refer to :ref:`the Event Buffer documentation <section_inputs_eventbuffer>` for more information.

Java Threads Creation
+++++++++++++++++++++

The number of threads in the MicroEJ Application must be sufficient to support the creation of additional threads when using ``Timer`` and ``Thread``.
The number of available threads can be updated in the launch configuration of the application (see :ref:`option_number_of_threads`).

If it is not possible to increase the number of available threads (for
example, because the memory is full), try to reuse another thread but
not the UI thread.

UART Not Available
++++++++++++++++++

If the UART output is not available, use another method to signal that
the heartbeat task is running (e.g., blink an LED, use SystemView).

Use Case 2: Debugging a HardFault
---------------------------------

When the application crashes, it can result from a HardFault triggered by the MCU.

The following sections explain:

1. What are exceptions, HardFaults, and the exception handler.
2. What to do in case of Memory Corruptions.
3. What to do when a HardFault occurs.

Exceptions, HardFaults And Exception Handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*From ARM Architecture Reference Manual*

   An exception causes the processor to suspend program execution to handle an event, such as an externally generated interrupt or an attempt to execute an undefined instruction. Exceptions can be generated by internal and external sources.
   Normally, when an exception is taken, the processor state is preserved immediately, before handling the exception.
   This means that, when the event has been handled, the original state can be restored and program execution resumed from the point where the exception was taken.

For example, an *IRQ request* is an exception that can be recovered by handling the hardware request properly.
On the other hand, an *Undefined Instruction* exception suggests a more severe system failure that might not be recoverable.

The exceptions that cannot be recovered are named **HardFaults**.

*From ARM Architecture Reference Manual*

   When an exception is taken, processor execution is forced to an address that corresponds to the type of exception.
   This address is called the **exception vector** for that exception.

The code pointed by the exception vector is named **exception handler**.
Therefore, a dedicated exception handler can be configured for all exceptions, including HardFaults.

Possible exceptions can be:

* Data Abort exception (access to unknown address)
* Undefined Instruction exception (execute code that is not valid)
* ...

Check the hardware documentation for the complete list of exceptions.

What To Do In Exception Handlers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For all HardFault handlers, the following data are available and must be printed:

* Name and value of all registers available
* Name of the handler
* Address of the failing instruction

Optionally:

* Content of the stack
* Call function ``LLMJVM_dump`` (from ``LLMJVM.h``) to display the VM state (see :ref:`vm_dump`)

Refer to the architecture documentation for how to configure the exception interrupt vector.

Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Memory Protection Unit (MPU) is a hardware unit that provides memory protection.
An MPU allows privileged software to define memory regions and their policy.
The policy describes who can access the memory.

For example, configure the heap and stack of a task to be accessible from the task itself only.
The MPU generates an exception if another task or a device driver attempts to access the memory region.

If applicable, configure the MPU should to protect the application.

* Check the RTOS documentation if it supports MPU. 

  For example, FreeRTOS includes FreeRTOS-MPU https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-MPU-memory-protection-unit.html.

* Configure the MPU to configure the access to the JVM heap and stack to prevent any other native threads from altering this area.
  Refer to :ref:`this section<core_engine_link>` for the list of section names defined by the MicroEJ Core Engine.

Memory Corruption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Memory corruption can result in the following symptoms:

* The address of the failing instruction is in a data section.
* The trace is incomplete or incorrect.
* The address of the failing instruction is located in the Garbage Collector (GC).

The cause(s) of a memory corruption can be:

* A native (C) function has a bug and writes to an incorrect memory location
* A native stack overflow
* A native heap overflow
* A device incorrectly initialized or misconfigured.
* ...

When the HardFault occurs in the MicroJVM task, the VM task heap or stack may be corrupted.
Add ``LLMJVM_checkIntegrity`` call in checkpoints of the BSP code to identify the timeslot of the memory corruption.
Typically, you can check a native with:

.. code-block:: java

   void Java_com_mycompany_MyClass_myNativeFunction(void) {
   	int32_t crcBefore = LLMJVM_checkIntegrity();
   	myNativeFunctionDo();
   	int32_t crcAfter = LLMJVM_checkIntegrity();
   	if(crcBefore != crcAfter){
   		// Corrupted memory in MicroJVM virtual machine internal structures
   		while(1);
   	}
   }

Investigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determine which memory regions are affected and determine which components are responsible for the corruption.

* List all the memories available and their specifics:

    * Access mode (addressable, DMA, ...)
    * Cache mechanism? L1, L2

* Is low-power enabled for CPU and peripherals? Is the memory disabled/changed to save power?
* Get the memory layout of the project:

    * What are the code sections for the BSP and the Application?
    * Where are the BSP stack and heap? What about the Application stack and heap?
    * Where is the Java immortals heap?
    * Where are the Java strings?
    * Where is the MicroEJ UI buffer?
    * Besides the Java immortals, what are the other intersection point between the Java application and the BSP? (e.g., a temporary RAM buffer for JPEG decoder).
    * Please refer to the :ref:`Core Engine Link section <core_engine_link>` to locate the Application sections, and to the :ref:`application_options` for their sizes.

* Implement a CRC of the *hot sections* when entering/leaving all natives. *Hot Sections* are memory sections used by both Java code and native code (e.g., C or ASM).

* Move the C stack at the beginning of the memory to trigger a crash when it overflows (instead of corrupting the memory).

When a HardFault Occurs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extract Information and Coredump
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Attach an embedded debugger and get the following information:

* stack traces and registers information for each stack frame
* memory information

    * the whole memory, if possible
    * otherwise, get the *hot sections* 

        * BSP and Java heap and stack
        * UI buffer
        * immortals heap
        * sections where the Java application and BSP are working together

* :ref:`vm_dump_debugger`

* Check which function is located at the address inside the PC register.

  * It can be done either in Debug mode or by searching inside the generated .map file.


Memory Dump Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Run the Heap Dumper to check the application heap has not been corrupted.
* Make sure the native stack is not full (usually, there shall have the remaining initialization patterns in memory on top of the stack, such as ``0xDEADBEEF``)

Trigger a VM Dump
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``LLMJVM_dump`` function is provided by ``LLMJVM.h``.
This function prints the VM state.
Data printed in the VM state are:

* List of Java threads
* Stack trace for each thread

See :ref:`this section<vm_dump>` to learn more about ``LLMJVM_dump``.
