Release Notes

Introduction
------------

Starting from MicroEJ version ``5.0.0``, MicroEJ Architectures are distributed separately from MicroEJ SDK. MicroEJ Architectures for Evaluation can be downloaded from the  `Architectures Repository <https://repository.microej.com/architectures>`_. MicroEJ Architectures for Production can be downloaded from the  `License Server <https://license.microej.com>`_ or from `MicroEJ Support <mailto:support@microej.com>`_.

MicroEJ Studio (resp. SDK) is now packaged into an Eclipse P2 repository (`<https://repository.microej.com/p2/studio>`_), allowing partial updates and installation on any compatible Eclipse version. The historical version (``5``) of MicroEJ is reused for the P2 repository delivery.

MicroEJ continues to regularly build all-in-one packages, called *Distributions*, including an Eclipse base version, various utility plugins, and dedicated OS installers. This distribution has a separate versioning, which follows modern convention: ``[YY].[MM]``.
