Introducing MicroEJ Studio and Virtual Devices
==============================================

MicroEJ Studio provides tools based on Eclipse to develop software
applications for MicroEJ-ready devices. MicroEJ Studio allows
application developers to write MicroEJ Applications, run them on a
virtual (simulated) or real device, and publish them to a MicroEJ Forge
instance.

This document is an introduction to application development with MicroEJ
Studio. The purpose of MicroEJ Studio is to develop for targeted MCU/MPU
computers (IoT, wearable, etc.) and it is therefore a cross-development
tool.

Unlike standard low-level cross-development tools, MicroEJ Studio offers
unique services like hardware simulation, deployment to the target
hardware and final publication to a MicroEJ Forge instance.

Application development is based on the following elements:

-  MicroEJ Studio, the integrated development environment for writing
   applications. It is based on Eclipse and relies on the integrated
   Java compiler (JDT). It also provides a dependency manager for
   managing MicroEJ Libraries (see :ref:`mmm`).
   The current distribution of MicroEJ Studio (``19.05``) is built on top of Eclipse Oxygen
   (`<https://www.eclipse.org/oxygen/>`_).

-  MicroEJ Virtual Device, a software package including the resources
   and tools required for building and testing an application for a
   specific MicroEJ-ready device. A Virtual Device will simulate all
   capabilities of the corresponding hardware board:

   -  Computation and Memory,

   -  Communication channels (e.g. Network, USB ...),

   -  Display,

   -  User interaction.

   Virtual Devices are imported into MicroEJ Studio within a local
   folder called MicroEJ Repository. Once a Virtual Device is imported,
   an application can be launched and tested on Simulator. It also
   provides a mean to locally deploy the application on a MicroEJ-ready
   device.

-  MicroEJ-ready device, a hardware device that has been previously
   programmed with a MicroEJ Firmware. A MicroEJ Firmware is a binary
   instance of MicroEJ runtime for a target hardware board.
   MicroEJ-ready devices are built using MicroEJ SDK. MicroEJ Virtual
   Devices and MicroEJ Firmwares share the same version (there is a 1:1
   mapping).
