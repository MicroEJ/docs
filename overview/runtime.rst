MicroEJ Runtime
===============

.. _mjvm_javalanguage:

Language
--------

MicroEJ is compatible with the Java language version 7.

Java source code is compiled by the Java compiler [1]_ into the binary format specified in the JVM specification [2]_. 
This binary code needs to be linked before execution: .class files and some other application-related files (see :ref:`MicroEJ Classpath <chapter.microej.classpath>`) are compiled to produce the final application that the MicroEJ Runtime can execute.

MicroEJ complies with the deterministic class initialization (<clinit>) order specified in :ref:`[BON] <esr-specifications>`. The application is statically analyzed from its entry points in order to generate a clinit dependency graph. The computed clinit sequence is the result of the topological sort of the dependency graph. An error is thrown if the clinit dependency graph contains cycles.

Scheduler
---------

The MicroEJ Architecture features a green thread platform that can
interact with the C world :ref:`[SNI] <esr-specifications>`. The (green) thread policy is as
follows:

-  preemptive for different priorities,

-  round-robin for same priorities,

-  "priority inheritance protocol" when priority inversion occurs. [3]_

MicroEJ stacks (associated with the threads) automatically adapt their
sizes according to the thread requirements: Once the thread has
finished, its associated stack is reclaimed, freeing the corresponding
RAM memory.


Garbage Collector
-----------------

The MicroEJ Architecture includes a state-of-the-art memory management
system, the Garbage Collector (GC). It manages a bounded piece of RAM
memory, devoted to the Java world. The GC automatically frees dead Java
objects, and defragments the memory in order to optimize RAM usage. This
is done transparently while the MicroEJ Applications keep running.

Foundation Libraries
--------------------

Embedded Device Configuration (EDC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Embedded Device Configuration specification defines the minimal
standard runtime environment for embedded devices. It defines all
default API packages:

-  java.io

-  java.lang

-  java.lang.annotation

-  java.lang.ref

-  java.lang.reflect

-  java.util

Beyond Profile (BON)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`[BON] <esr-specifications>` defines a suitable and flexible way to fully control both memory
usage and start-up sequences on devices with limited memory resources.
It does so within the boundaries of Java semantics. More precisely, it
allows:

-  Controlling the initialization sequence in a deterministic way.

-  Defining persistent, immutable, read-only objects (that may be placed
   into non-volatile memory areas), and which do not require copies to
   be made in RAM to be manipulated.

-  Defining immortal, read-write objects that are always alive.

- Defining and accessing compile-time constants.

   This protocol raises the priority of a thread (that is holding a
   resource needed by a higher priority task) to the priority of that
   task.
