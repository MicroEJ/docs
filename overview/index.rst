MicroEJ offers a comprehensive toolset to build the embedded software of
a device. The toolset covers two levels in device software development:

-  MicroEJ SDK for device firmware development

The firmware will generally be produced by the device OEM, it includes
all device drivers and a specific set of MicroEJ functionalities useful

   MicroEJ Development Tools Overview

Using the MicroEJ SDK tool, a firmware developer will produce two
versions of the MicroEJ binary, each one able to run applications
created with the MicroEJ Studio tool:

-  A MicroEJ Firmware binary to be flashed on OEM devices;

-  A Virtual Device which will be used as a device simulator by
   application developers.

Using the MicroEJ Studio tool, an application developer will be able to:

-  Import Virtual Devices matching his target hardware in order to
   develop and test applications on the Simulator;

-  Deploy the application locally on an hardware device equipped with
   the MicroEJ Firmware;

-  Package and publish the application on a MicroEJ Forge Instance,
   enabling remote end users to install it on their devices. For more
   information about MicroEJ Forge, please consult
