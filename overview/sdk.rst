MICROEJ SDK
===========

MICROEJ SDK offers a comprehensive toolset to build the embedded software of
a device. The SDK covers two levels in device software development:

-  Device Firmware development
-  Application development

The firmware will generally be produced by the device OEM, it includes
all device drivers and a specific set of MicroEJ functionalities useful
for application developers targeting this device.

   SDK Workflow Overview

Using the SDK, a firmware developer will produce two
versions of the MicroEJ binary, each one able to run applications:

-  An Executable binary to be flashed on OEM devices;

-  A Virtual Device which will be used as a device simulator by
   application developers.

Using the SDK, an application developer will be able to:

-  Import Virtual Devices matching his target hardware in order to
   develop and test applications on the Simulator;

-  Deploy the application locally on a hardware device equipped with
   the Firmware;

-  Package and publish the application on a MicroEJ Forge Instance,
   enabling remote end users to install it on their devices. For more
   information about MicroEJ Forge, please consult

The following diagram outlines the SDK content. Please refer to the :ref:`sdk_user_guide` chapter for more details on the SDK and its usage.
