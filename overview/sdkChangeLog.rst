MicroEJ SDK Distribution Changelog
----------------------------------

[21.03] - 2021-03-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Included :ref:`MicroEJ Studio / SDK 5.4.0 <changelog-5.4.0>`
  
.. _known-issues-21.03:

**KNOWN ISSUES**:

-  See :ref:`MicroEJ Studio / SDK 5.4.0 Known Issues <known-issues-5.4.0>` section

[20.12] - 2020-12-11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Included :ref:`MicroEJ Studio / SDK 5.3.1 <changelog-5.3.0>`
-  Disabled Java version check when updating MicroEJ Studio/SDK (see
   :ref:`known issues of Studio/SDK Distribution 20.10 <known-issues-20.10>`)

[20.10] - 2020-10-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Included :ref:`MicroEJ Studio / SDK 5.3.0 <changelog-5.3.0>`
-  Updated to Eclipse version ``2020-06``
-  Fixed low quality MacOS SDK icons

**NOTE:** Starting with this release, only 64bits JRE are supported
because 32bits JRE support has been removed since Eclipse version
``2018-12``. See `this
link <https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.10/platform.php#java32-removal>`__
for more details.

.. _known-issues-20.10:

**KNOWN ISSUES**:

-  Projects configured with Null Analysis must be updated to import `EDC
   API 1.3.3 <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/edc/1.3.3/>`__
   or higher in order to avoid an Eclipse JDT builder error (see also
   `this link <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566599>`__
   for more details).
-  The default settings file for connecting MicroEJ Central Repository
   is not automatically installed. To connect to the MicroEJ Central
   Repository, follow the procedure:

   -  For Windows, create the folder: ``C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.microej``.
   -  For Linux, create the folder: ``/home/$USER/.microej``.
   -  For macos, create the folder: ``/Users/$USER/.microej``.
   -  Download and save this file `microej-ivysettings-5.xml <https://repository.microej.com/microej-ivysettings-5.xml>`__ to the previously created ``.microej`` folder.
-  By default, a check is done on the JRE version required by the
   plugins on install/update. Since CDT requires JRE 11, it prevents to
   install/update a newer MicroEJ SDK version. The CDT documentation
   explains that this can be bypassed by disabling the option
   :guilabel:`Windows` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`Install/Update` > :guilabel:`Verify provisioning operation is compatible with currently running JRE`.

[20.07] - 2020-07-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Included :ref:`MicroEJ Studio / SDK 5.2.0 <changelog-5.2.0>`
-  Updated the default microej repository folder name (replaced MicroEJ
   Studio/SDK version by the distribution number)
-  Added ``Dist.`` prefix in installer name (e.g.
   ``MicroEJ SDK Dist. 20.07``) to avoid confusion between MicroEJ SDK
   distribution vs MicroEJ SDK version
-  Updated MicroEJ SDK and MicroEJ Studio End User License Agreement
-  Disabled popup window when installing a MicroEJ SDK update site
   (allow to install unsigned content by default)

[19.05] - 2019-05-17

-  Updated MicroEJ icons (``16x16`` and ``32x32``)
-  Updated the publisher of Windows executables (``MicroEJ`` instead of
   ``IS2T SA.``)
-  Updated the JRE link to download in case the default JRE is not
   compatible. (``https://www.java.com`` is deprecated)

-  Included :ref:`MicroEJ Studio / SDK version 5.0.1 <changelog-5.0.1>`

""""""""""""

-  Some older build types versions have been removed by error.
   Consequently, using MicroEJ SDK ``5.4.0``, it may be not possible to
   build modules that have been created with an older MicroEJ SDK
   version (For example, `MicroEJ
   GitHub <https://github.com/MicroEJ/>`__ code). The list of missing
   build types:

   -  ``[Studio]`` build-application ``7.0.2``
   -  ``[Studio]`` build-microej-javalib ``4.1.1``
   -  ``[SDK]`` build-firmware-singleapp ``1.2.10``
