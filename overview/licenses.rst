License Manager Overview
------------------------

MicroEJ Architectures are distributed in two different versions:

- Evaluation Architectures, associated with a software license key. They can be downloaded at `<https://repository.microej.com/architectures/>`_.
- Production Architectures, associated with a hardware license key stored on a USB dongle. They can be requested to :ref:`our support team <get_support>`.

The license manager is provided with MicroEJ Architectures and then integrated into Platforms, consequently:

- Evaluation licenses will be shown only if at least one Evaluation Architecture or Platform built from an Evaluation Architecture 
  has been imported in MicroEJ SDK.
- Production licenses will be shown only if at least one Production Architecture or Platform built from a Production Architecture 
  has been imported in MicroEJ SDK.

See sections :ref:`architecture_import` and :ref:`platform_import` for more information.


The list of installed licenses is available in MicroEJ SDK preferences dialog page in :guilabel:`Window`
> :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ`:

Evaluation Licenses
-------------------

This section should be considered when using Evaluation Architectures, which
use software license keys. A machine UID needs to be provided
to activate an Evaluation license on the MicroEJ Licenses Server. The machine UID is a 16 hexadecimal digits number.

Get your Machine UID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retrieving the machine UID depends on the kind of MicroEJ Platform being evaluated.

If your MicroEJ Platform is already :ref:`imported in Package Explorer <source_platform_import>` and built with :ref:`mmm`, the MicroEJ Architecture has been automatically imported.
The machine UID will be displayed when building a :ref:`MicroEJ Standalone Application on device <device_build>`.

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   [INFO ] Launching in Evaluation mode. Your UID is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
   [ERROR] Invalid license check (No license found).

Otherwise, a MicroEJ Architecture or Platform should have been manually imported from the MicroEJ SDK preferences page. 
The machine UID can be retrieved as follows:

- Go to :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ`,
- Select either :guilabel:`Architectures` or :guilabel:`Platforms`, 
- Click on one of the available Architectures or Platforms,
- Press the :guilabel:`Get UID` button to get the machine UID.

.. note:: 

   To access this :guilabel:`Get UID` option, at least one Evaluation Architecture or Platform must have been imported before (see :ref:`license_manager`).

Copy the UID. It will be needed when requesting a license.

.. note:: 
   
   You can check the :guilabel:`My Products` page to verify your product registration status, the Activation Key availability, and download the Activation Key when available.

Once the Activation Key is available, download and save the Activation Key ZIP file to a local directory.

.. _production_license_activate:

Activate your USB Dongle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains instructions that will allow you to flash your
USB dongle with the proper activation key.

You shall ensure that the following prerequisites are met :

-  Your :ref:`operating system <system-requirements>` is Windows 

-  The USB dongle is plugged and recognized by your operating system
   (see :ref:`production_license_troubleshooting` section)

-  No more than one USB dongle is plugged into the computer while running the
   update tool

-  The update tool is not launched from a network drive or a USB
   key

-  The activation key you downloaded is the one for the dongle UID on
   the sticker attached to the dongle (each activation key is tied to
   the unique hardware ID of the dongle).

You can then proceed to the USB dongle update: 

- Unzip the ``Activation Key`` file to a local directory 
- Enter the directory just created by your ZIP extraction tool.
- Launch the executable program.
- Accept running the unsigned software if requested (Windows 10)

.. _production_license_check:

Check Activation on MicroEJ SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Production licenses will be shown only if at least one Production Architecture or Platform has been imported before (see :ref:`license_manager`).

- Go back to MicroEJ SDK,
- Go to :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ`,
- Go to :guilabel:`Architectures` or :guilabel:`Platforms` sub-menu and check that all Production Architectures or Platforms are now activated (green check).

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains instructions to check that your
operating system correctly recognizes your USB dongle.

GNU/Linux Troubleshooting
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

For GNU/Linux Users (Ubuntu at least), by default, the dongle access has
not been granted to the user, you have to modify udev rules. Please
create a ``/etc/udev/rules.d/91-usbdongle.rules`` file with the
following contents:

::

   ACTION!="add", GOTO="usbdongle_end"
       SUBSYSTEM=="usb", GOTO="usbdongle_start"
       SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", GOTO="usbdongle_start"
       GOTO="usbdongle_end"
       
       LABEL="usbdongle_start"
       
       ATTRS{idVendor}=="096e" , ATTRS{idProduct}=="0006" , MODE="0666"
       
       LABEL="usbdongle_end"

Then, restart udev: ``/etc/init.d/udev restart``

You can check that the device is recognized by running the ``lsusb``
command. The output of the command should contain a line similar to the
one below for each dongle:
``Bus 002 Device 003: ID 096e:0006 Feitian Technologies, Inc.``

Windows Troubleshooting
"""""""""""""""""""""""

- If the :ref:`dongle activation <production_license_activate>` failed with ``No rockey`` message, check there is one and only one dongle recognized with the following hardware ID :

  ::

     HID\VID_096E&PID_0006&REV_0201

  Go to the :guilabel:`Device Manager` > :guilabel:`Human Interface Devices` and
  check among the :guilabel:`USB Input Device` entries that the
  :guilabel:`Details` > :guilabel:`Hardware Ids` property match the ID mentioned before.


- If the :ref:`dongle activation <production_license_activate>` was successful with ``Update successfully`` message but the license does not appear in MicroEJ SDK or is not updated, 
  try to activate again by starting the executable with administrator privileges:

  .. figure:: images/dongle/runAsAdministrator.png

- If the following error message is thrown when building a MicroEJ Firmware, either the dongle plugged is a verbatim dongle or it has not been successfully :ref:`activated <production_license_activate>`:

  .. code-block:: console

     Invalid license check (Dongle found is not compatible).

VirtualBox Troubleshooting
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In a VirtualBox virtual machine, USB drives must be enabled to be recognized correctly.
Make sure to enable the USB dongle by clicking on it in the VirtualBox menu :guilabel:`Devices` > :guilabel:`USB`.

To make this setting persistent, go to :guilabel:`Devices` > :guilabel:`USB` > :guilabel:`USB Settings...`
and add the USB dongle in the :guilabel:`USB Devices Filters` list.
