- Select between one of the available boards;
- Import a demo Application;   
- Download and install the corresponding Platform for the target hardware;
- Run the Application on Simulator with a Virtual Device;
- Build the Application for the target hardware to produce a Firmware;
- Deploy the Firmware on the board.
