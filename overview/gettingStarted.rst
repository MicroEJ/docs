Starting from scratch, the steps to go through the whole process are:

- Download and install an SDK Distribution;
- Select between one of the available boards;
- Import a demo Application;   
- Download and install the corresponding VEE Port for the target hardware;
- Run the Application on Simulator with a Virtual Device;
- Build the Application for the target hardware to produce a Firmware;
- Deploy the Firmware on the board.

The following figure gives an overview of the SDK workflow:
