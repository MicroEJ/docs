=============
Multi-Sandbox
=============


Principle
=========

The Multi-Sandbox capability of the MicroEJ Core Engine allows a
main application (called Standalone Application) to install and execute
at runtime additional applications (called Sandboxed Applications).

The MicroEJ Core Engine implements the :ref:`[KF] specification <esr-specifications>`. A Kernel is a
Standalone Application generated on a Multi-Sandbox-enabled
platform. A Feature is a Sandboxed Application generated against a specific Kernel.

A Sandboxed Application may be dynamically downloaded at runtime or
integrated at build-time within the executable application.

Functional Description
======================

The Multi-Sandbox process extends the overall process described in
:ref:`the overview of the platform process <build_process_overview>`.

   Multi-Sandbox Process

Once a Kernel has been generated, additional MicroEJ Application code
(Feature) can be built against the Kernel . 
The binary application file produced (``application.fo``) is compatible only
for the Kernel on which it was generated. Generating a new Kernel
requires that you generate the Features again on this Kernel.

For more details, please refer to the :ref:`Kernel Developer Guide <kernel-developer-guide>`,
especially :ref:`Multi-Sandbox Kernel link <kernel_link>` and :ref:`Sandboxed Application link <application_link>` sections.

Memory Considerations
=====================

Multi-Sandbox memory overhead of MicroEJ Core Engine runtime
elements are described in :ref:`the table below <table_kf-overhead>`.

Dependencies
============

-  ``LLKERNEL_impl.h`` implementation (see :ref:`LLKF-API-SECTION`).


Installation
============

Multi-Sandbox is an additional module, disabled by default.

To enable Multi-Sandbox of the MicroEJ Core Engine, in the platform
configuration file, check :guilabel:`Multi Applications`.


Use
===

The `KF API Module <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/kf/>`_ 
must be added to the :ref:`module.ivy <mmm_module_description>` of the MicroEJ 
Application project to use :ref:`[KF] <esr-specifications>` library.

::

   <dependency org="ej.api" name="kf" rev="1.4.4"/>

This library provides a set of options. Refer to the chapter
:ref:`application_options` which lists all available options.
