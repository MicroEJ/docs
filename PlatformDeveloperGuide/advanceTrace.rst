Advanced Event Tracing
######################

Principle
=========

MicroEJ Core Engine allows method execution to be profiled. The following two new hooks functions are used for that:

- ``LLMJVM_MONITOR_IMPL_on_invoke_method`` called at the start of the method invocation.
- ``LLMJVM_MONITOR_IMPL_on_return_method`` called when returning from the invoked method.

Calling these functions each time a method is invoked will slow down the application execution,
so these functions are not called by default when event tracing is enabled and started.

.. note::
   This feature is available in the Architecture versions 7.17.0 or higher for the Applications deployed on hardware devices (not on Simulator).

To activate them, you need to follow these steps:

- Enable and start the trace :ref:`see here <event_enable_recording>`
- Tell the third-party linker program to redirect all calls to ``LLMJVM_invoke_method`` and ``LLMJVM_return_method`` symbols to respectively ``LLMJVM_invoke_method_with_trace`` and ``LLMJVM_return_method_with_trace`` symbols.

Platforms using GNU LD linker
=============================

Add the following options to the LD linker command line:

.. code-block:: sh

    --require-defined=LLMJVM_invoke_method_with_trace
    --defsym=LLMJVM_invoke_method=LLMJVM_invoke_method_with_trace
    --require-defined=LLMJVM_return_method_with_trace
    --defsym=LLMJVM_return_method=LLMJVM_return_method_with_trace


Platforms using IAR ILINK linker
================================

Pass the following options to the ILINK linker program

.. code-block:: sh

    --redirect LLMJVM_invoke_method=LLMJVM_invoke_method_with_trace
    --redirect LLMJVM_return_method=LLMJVM_return_method_with_trace
