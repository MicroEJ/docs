Platform Creation
=================

This section describes the steps to create a new MicroEJ Platform in MicroEJ SDK, 
and options to connect it to an external Board Support Package (BSP) as well as a third-party C toolchain. 

.. note::
   
   If you own a legacy Platform, you can either create your Platform again from scratch,
   or follow the :ref:`former_platform_migration` chapter.

.. _architecture_import:

MicroEJ Architecture Import
===========================

The first step is to choose and import a :ref:`MicroEJ Architecture <architecture_overview>`. 

MicroEJ Corp. provides MicroEJ Evaluation Architectures for most common microcontroller instructions sets and compilers
at https://repository.microej.com/modules/ [#note_production]_. 

Once you downloaded a MicroEJ Architecture file, proceed with the following steps to import it in MicroEJ SDK:

- Select :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`Import` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ` > :guilabel:`Architectures`.
- Browse an ``.xpf`` file or a folder that contains one or more an ``.xpf`` files.
- Check the :guilabel:`I agree and accept the above terms and conditions...` box to accept the license.
- Click on :guilabel:`Finish` button.

.. [#note_production] If the requested MicroEJ Architecture is not available for evaluation or to get a MicroEJ Production Architecture, please contact your MicroEJ sales representative.

.. _pack_import:

MicroEJ Pack Import
===================

The next step is to choose and import a :ref:`MicroEJ Pack
<pack_overview>`.  MicroEJ Corp. provides MicroEJ Packs to provide
additional features.

.. _pack_manual_import:

Manual Import 
-------------

This section is only relevant for older MicroEJ Platforms with no :ref:`mmm_module_description`.
These Platforms are built from MicroEJ Architecture Specific Packs and Legacy MicroEJ Generic Packs (packaged as ``.xpfp`` files) that must be imported manually.

Once you downloaded a MicroEJ Pack file, proceed with the
following steps to import it in MicroEJ SDK:

- Select :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`Import` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ` > :guilabel:`Architectures`.
- Browse an ``.xpfp`` file or a folder that contains one or more an ``.xpfp`` files.
- Check the :guilabel:`I agree and accept the above terms and conditions...` box to accept the license.
- Click on :guilabel:`Finish` button.

.. _platform_configuration_creation:

MicroEJ Platform Configuration
==============================

The next step is to create a MicroEJ Platform configuration:

-  Select :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`New` > :guilabel:`Platform Project`.

-  The Configure Target Architecture page allows to
   select the MicroEJ Architecture. This can be
   changed later.

   -  Click on :guilabel:`Browse...` button to select one of the installed MicroEJ
      Architecture.

   -  Uncheck the :guilabel:`Create from a platform reference implementation` box.

-  Click on :guilabel:`Next` button. The ``Configure platform properties`` page contains the
   identification of the MicroEJ Platform to create. Most fields are
   mandatory, you should therefore set them. Note that their values can
   be modified later on.

-  Click on :guilabel:`Finish` button. A new project ``[device]-[name]-[toolchain]`` is being created
   containing a ``[name].platform`` file. The Platform Editor shall then
   open.

-  Install `Platform Configuration Additions <https://github.com/MicroEJ/PlatformQualificationTools/blob/master/framework/platform/>`_. 
   Files within the ``content`` folder have to be copied to the configuration project folder,
   by following instructions described at https://github.com/MicroEJ/PlatformQualificationTools/blob/master/framework/platform/README.rst.
   
   You should get a MicroEJ Platform configuration project that looks like:

   .. figure:: images/platformConfigurationSkeleton.png
      :alt: MicroEJ Platform Configuration Project Skeleton
      :align: center

      MicroEJ Platform Configuration Project Skeleton

- Edit the ``module.properties`` file and set the option ``com.microej.platformbuilder.platform.filename`` to the ``[name].platform`` file name.

  .. code-block::

     com.microej.platformbuilder.platform.filename=myplatform.platform

- Edit the :ref:`mmm_module_description` ``module.ivy`` to declare the dependency line to the MicroEJ Architecture previously downloaded:

  .. code-block:: xml
     :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5

     <dependencies>

        <dependency org="com.microej.architecture.[ISA].[TOOLCHAIN]" name="[UID]" rev="[VERSION]">
          <artifact name="[UID]" m:classifier="[USAGE]" ext="xpf"/>
        </dependency>
     
     </dependencies>

  For example, to declare the MicroEJ Evaluation Architecture version ``7.14.0`` for Arm速 Cortex速-M4 microcontrollers compiled with GNU CC toolchain:

  .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5

      <dependencies>

          <dependency org="com.microej.architecture.CM4.CM4hardfp_GCC48" name="flopi4G25" rev="7.14.0">
            <artifact name="flopi4G25" m:classifier="eval" ext="xpf"/>
          </dependency>
      
      </dependencies>
      
- Edit the :ref:`mmm_module_description` ``module.ivy`` to declare the dependency line to the MicroEJ Packs previously downloaded:

  .. code-block:: xml
     :emphasize-lines: 3,6,9

     <dependencies>
        <!-- MicroEJ Architecture Specific Pack and Legacy MicroEJ Generic Pack  -->
        <dependency org="com.microej.architecture.[ISA].[TOOLCHAIN]" name="[UID]-[NAME]-pack" rev="[VERSION]"/>

        <!-- MicroEJ Generic Pack  -->
        <dependency org="com.microej.pack.[NAME]" name="[NAME]-pack" rev="[VERSION]"/>

        <!-- Legacy MicroEJ Generic Pack -->
        <dependency org="com.microej.pack" name="[NAME]" rev="[VERSION]"/>

     </dependencies>

  For example, to declare the MicroEJ Architecture Specific Pack UI
  version ``13.0.4`` for MicroEJ Architecture ``flopi4G25`` on Arm速
  Cortex速-M4 microcontrollers compiled with GNU CC toolchain:

  .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 3

      <dependencies>
          <!-- MicroEJ Architecture Specific Pack -->
          <dependency org="com.microej.architecture.CM4.CM4hardfp_GCC48" name="flopi4G25-ui-pack" rev="13.0.4"/>

      </dependencies>

  To declare the MicroEJ Generic Pack Bluetooth version ``2.1.0``:

  .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 3

      <dependencies>
        <!-- MicroEJ Generic Pack  -->
          <dependency org="com.microej.pack.bluetooth" name="bluetooth-pack" rev="2.1.0"/>

      </dependencies>

  And to declare the Legacy MicroEJ Generic Pack Net version ``9.2.3``:

  .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 3

      <dependencies>
        <!-- Legacy MicroEJ Generic Pack -->
        <dependency org="com.microej.pack" name="net" rev="9.2.3"/>

      </dependencies>

.. _platform_build:

MicroEJ Platform Build
======================


To build the MicroEJ Platform, perform as a regular :ref:`mmm_module_build`: 

  - Right-click on the Platfom Configuration project,
  - Select :guilabel:`Build Module`.
  - The build starts and the build logs are redirected to the integrated console. Once the build is terminated, you should get the following message:

    .. code-block:: console
      :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5,6
      
      module-platform:report:
        [echo]     ============================================================================================================
        [echo]     Platform has been built in this directory 'C:\tmp\mydevice-Platform-mytoolchain-0.0.1'.
        [echo]     To import this project in your MicroEJ SDK workspace (if not already available):
        [echo]      - Select 'File' > 'Import...' > 'General' > 'Existing Projects into Workspace' > 'Next'
        [echo]      - Check 'Select root directory' and browse 'C:\tmp\mydevice-Platform-mytoolchain-0.0.1' > 'Finish'
        [echo]     ============================================================================================================

      BUILD SUCCESSFUL

      Total time: 43 seconds
  
Then, import the Platform directory to your MicroEJ SDK workspace as mentioned in the report. You should get a ready-to-use MicroEJ Platform project
in the workspace available for the MicroEJ Application project to run on. You can also check the MicroEJ Platform availability in:
:guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ` > :guilabel:`Platforms in workspace`.

.. figure:: images/platformSource.png
   :alt: MicroEJ Platform Project
   :align: center

   MicroEJ Platform Project
 
This step is only required the first time the Platform is built, or if the Platform properties haved changed. 
When the same Platform is rebuilt, right-click on the Platform project and select :guilabel:`Refresh` to get the new content.

.. _platform_configuration_modules:

Platform Groups / Modules Selection
===================================

From the Platform Editor, select the Content tab to access the
Platform modules selection.  Platform modules can be
selected/deselected from the Modules frame.

Platform modules are provided by MicroEJ Architecture Specific Packs
and Legacy MicroEJ Generic Packs.  Platform modules are organized into groups.
When a group is selected, by default, all its modules are selected.
To view the modules making up a group, click on the Show/Hide modules
icon on the top-right of the frame.  This will let you select/deselect
on a per module basis.  Note that individual module selection is not
recommended and that it is only available when the module have been
imported.

The description and contents of an item (group or module) are displayed
beside the list on item selection.

All the checked Platform modules will be installed in the Platform.

.. figure:: images/platformConfigurationModules.png
   :alt: MicroEJ Platform Configuration Modules Selection
   :align: center

   MicroEJ Platform Configuration Modules Selection

.. note::

  It is possible to quickly rebuild the Platform from the Platform Editor when only changes have been made in the Platform Editor.
  Click on the :guilabel:`Build Platform` link on the Platform configuration :guilabel:`Overview` tab.


Platform Modules Customization
==============================

Each selected Platform module can be customized by creating a [module]
folder named after the module beside the ``[name].platform``
definition. It may contain:

-  An optional [module].properties file named after the module name.
   These properties will be injected in the execution context prefixed
   by the module name. Some properties might be needed for the
   configuration of some modules. Please refer to the modules
   documentation for more information.

-  Optional module specific files and folders.

Modifying one of these files requires to build the Platform again.


.. _platformCustomization:

Platform Customization
======================

Platforms can be customized by creating a ``configuration.xml`` Ant file
beside the ``[name].platform`` file. This Ant script can extend one or
several of the extension points available. By default, you should not have to change 
the default configuration script.

Here is a template for a ``configuration.xml`` Ant file:

.. code:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <project name="configuration">
   
   	<!--
   		Define "project.dir" property that references the directory 
   		where this file is located.
   	-->
   	<dirname property="project.dir" file="${ant.file.configuration}"/>
   
   </project>

Configuration project (the project which contains the
``[name].platform`` file) can contain an optional ``dropins`` folder.
The contents of this folder will be copied integrally into the final
Platform. This feature allows to add some additional libraries, tools
etc. into the Platform.

The dropins folder organization should respect the final Platform files
and folders organization. For instance, the tools are located in the
sub-folder ``tools``. Launch a Platform build without the dropins folder
to see how the Platform files and folders organization is. Then fill the
dropins folder with additional features and build again the Platform to
obtain an advanced Platform.

The dropins folder files are kept in priority. If one file has the same
path and name as another file already installed into the Platform, the
dropins folder file will be kept.

Modifying one of these files requires to build the Platform again.

.. _bsp_connection:

BSP Connection
==============

Principle
---------

Using a MicroEJ Platform, the user can compile a MicroEJ Application on that Platform. 
The result of this compilation is a ``microejapp.o`` file.

This file has to be linked with the MicroEJ Platform runtime file (``microejruntime.a``) 
and a third-party C project, called the Board Support Package (BSP),
to obtain the final binary file (MicroEJ Firmware).
For more information, please consult the :ref:`MicroEJ build process overview <build_process_overview>`.

The BSP connection can be configured by defining 4 folders where the following files are located:

- MicroEJ Application file (``microejapp.o``).
- MicroEJ Platform runtime file (``microejruntime.a``, also available in the Platform ``lib`` folder).
- MicroEJ Platform header files (``*.h``, also available in the Platform ``include`` folder).
- BSP project :ref:`build script <bsp_connection_build_script>` file (``build.bat`` or ``build.sh``).

Once the MicroEJ Application file (``microejapp.o``) is built, the files are then copied to these locations 
and the ``build.bat`` or ``build.sh`` file is executed to produce the final executable file (``application.out``).

.. note::

   The final build stage to produce the executable file can be done outside of MicroEJ SDK, and thus 
   the BSP connection configuration is optional.
   
   BSP connection configuration is only required in the following cases:

   - Use MicroEJ SDK to produce the final executable file of a Mono-Sandbox Firmware (recommended).
   - Use MicroEJ SDK to run a :ref:`MicroEJ Test Suite <platform_testsuite>` on device.
   - Build a Multi-Sandbox Firmware.

.. _bsp_connection_cases:

MicroEJ provides a flexible way to configure the BSP connection to target any kind of projects, teams organizations and company build flows.
To achieve this, the BSP connection can be configured either at MicroEJ Platform level or at MicroEJ Application level (or a mix of both). 

The 3 most common integration cases are:

- Case 1: No BSP connection

  The MicroEJ Platform does not know the BSP at all.

  BSP connection can be configured when building the MicroEJ Application (absolute locations).

  .. figure:: images/bsp-connection-cases-none.png
     :alt: MicroEJ Platform with no BSP connection
     :align: center
     :scale: 80%

     MicroEJ Platform with no BSP connection

  This case is recommended when:

  - the MicroEJ Firmware is built outside MicroEJ SDK.
  - the same MicroEJ Platform is intended to be reused on multiple BSP projects which do not share the same structure.

- Case 2: Partial BSP connection
  
  The MicroEJ Platform knows how the BSP is structured.

  BSP connection is configured when building the MicroEJ Platform (relative locations within the BSP), 
  and the BSP root location is configured when building the MicroEJ Application (absolute directory).

  .. figure:: images/bsp-connection-cases-partial.png
     :alt: MicroEJ Platform with partial BSP connection
     :align: center
     :scale: 80%

     MicroEJ Platform with partial BSP connection

  This case is recommended when:
  
  - the MicroEJ Platform is used to build one MicroEJ Application on top of one BSP. 
  - the Application and BSP are slightly coupled, thus making a change in the BSP just require to build the firmware again.

- Case 3: Full BSP connection
  
  The MicroEJ Platform includes the BSP.

  BSP connection is configured when building MicroEJ Platform (relative locations within the BSP), 
  as well as the BSP root location (absolute directory).
  No BSP connection configuration is required when building the MicroEJ Application.

  .. figure:: images/bsp-connection-cases-full.png
     :alt: MicroEJ Platform with full BSP connection
     :align: center
     :scale: 80%

     MicroEJ Platform with full BSP connection

  This case is recommended when:

  - the MicroEJ Platform is used to build various MicroEJ Applications.
  - the MicroEJ Platform is validated using MicroEJ test suites. 
  - the MicroEJ Platform and BSP are delivered as a single standalone module (same versioning), perhaps
    subcontracted to a team or a company outside the application project(s).

.. _bsp_connection_options:

Options
-------

BSP connection options can be specified as Platform options or as Application options or a mix of both.

The following table describes Platform options, configured in ``bsp/bsp.properties`` file of the Platform configuration project.

.. list-table:: MicroEJ Platform Options for BSP Connection
   :widths: 1 5 3 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option Name

     - The 3rd-party BSP project absolute directory, to be included to the Platform.
     - ``c:\\Users\\user\\mybsp`` on Windows systems or ``/home/user/bsp`` on Unix systems.

.. _bsp_connection_application_options:

The following table describes Application options, configured as regular :ref:`MicroEJ Application Options <application_options>`.

.. list-table:: MicroEJ Application Options for BSP Connection
   :widths: 1 5
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option Name   
     - Description
   * - ``deploy.bsp.microejapp``
     - Deploy the MicroEJ Application file (``microejapp.o``) to the location defined by the Platform (defaults to ``true`` when Platform option ``microejapp.relative.dir`` is set).
   * - ``deploy.bsp.microejlib``
     - Deploy the MicroEJ Platform runtime file (``microejruntime.a``) to the location defined by the Platform (defaults to ``true`` when Platform option ``microejlib.relative.dir`` is set).

     - Deploy the MicroEJ Application file (``microejapp.o``) to this absolute directory. An empty value means no deployment.
   * - ``deploy.dir.microejlib``
     - Deploy the MicroEJ Platform runtime file (``microejruntime.a``) to this absolute directory. An empty value means no deployment.
   * - ``deploy.dir.microejinc``

   * - ``deploy.dir.microejscript``
     - Execute the BSP build script file (``build.bat`` or ``build.sh``) present in this absolute directory. An empty value means no deployment.


.. note::

   It is also possible to configure the BSP root directory using the :ref:`build option <mmm_build_options>` ``toolchain.dir``, 
   instead of the application option ``deploy.bsp.root.dir``.
   This allow to configure a MicroEJ Firmware by specifying both the Platform (using the ``target.platform.dir`` option) and the BSP 
   at build level, without having to modify the application options files.

For each :ref:`Platform BSP connection case <bsp_connection_cases>`, here is a summary of the options to set: 

- No BSP connection, executable file built outside MicroEJ SDK
  :: 

    Platform Options:
      [NONE]

    Application Options:
      [NONE]

- No BSP connection, executable file built using MicroEJ SDK

  :: 

    Platform Options:
      microejapp.relative.dir=[relative_path]
      microejlib.relative.dir=[relative_path]

      microejscript.relative.dir=[relative_path]
      root.dir=[absolute_path]

    Application Options:
      deploy.bsp.microejscript=true

.. _bsp_connection_build_script:

Build Script File
-----------------

The BSP build script file is responsible to invoke the third-party C toolchain (compiler and linker)
to produce the final executable file (``application.out``).

The build script must implement the following specification:

- On Windows operating system, it is a Windows batch file named ``build.bat``.
- On Mac OS X or Linux operating systems, it is a shell script named ``build.sh``, with execution permission enabled.
- On error, the script must end with a non zero exit code.
- On success

  - The executable must be copied to the file ``application.out`` in the directory from
    where the script has been executed.
  - The script must end with zero exit code.

Many build script templates are available for most commonly used C toolchains in the 
`Platform Qualification Tools repository <https://github.com/MicroEJ/PlatformQualificationTools/tree/master/framework/platform/scripts>`_.

.. note::

    The final executable file must be an ELF executable file.  On
    Unix, the command ``file(1)`` can be use to check the format of a
    file.  For example:

    .. code-block:: sh

       ~$ file application.out
       ELF 32-bit LSB executable

.. _bsp_connection_run_script:

Run Script File
---------------

This script is required only for Platforms intended to run a :ref:`MicroEJ Testsuite <platform_testsuite>` on device.

The BSP run script is responsible to invoke a third-party tool to upload and start the executable file on device.

The run script must implement the following specification:

- On Windows operating system, it is a Windows batch file named ``run.bat``.
- On Mac OS X or Linux operating systems, it is a shell script named ``run.sh``, with execution permission enabled.
- The executable file is passed as first script parameter if there is one, otherwise it is the ``application.out`` file located in the directory from where the script has been executed.
- On error, the script must end with a non zero exit code.
- On success

  - The executable file (``application.out``) has been uploaded and started on the device
  - The script must end with zero exit code.

The run script can optionally redirect execution traces. If it does not implement execution traces redirection,
the testsuite must be configured with the following :ref:`application_options` in order to take its input from a TCP/IP socket server, 
such as :ref:`tool_serial_to_socket`.

.. code-block:: properties

  testsuite.trace.ip=localhost
  testsuite.trace.port=5555


Low Level APIs Implementation Files
-----------------------------------

Some Platform modules require additional information about the BSP
implementation of Low Level APIs.

This information must be stored in each Platform module's configuration folder, in a file named ``bsp.xml``.

This file must start with the node ``<bsp>``. It can contain several
lines like this one:
``<nativeName="A_LLAPI_NAME" nativeImplementation name="AN_IMPLEMENTATION_NAME"/>``
where:

-  ``A_LLAPI_NAME`` refers to a Low Level API native name. It is
   specific to the MicroEJ C library which provides the Low Level API.

-  ``AN_IMPLEMENTATION_NAME`` refers to the implementation name of the
   Low Level API. It is specific to the BSP; and more specifically, to
   the C file which does the link between the MicroEJ C library and the
   C driver.

Example:

::

   <bsp>
       <nativeImplementation name="COMM_DRIVER" nativeName="LLCOMM_BUFFERED_CONNECTION"/>
   </bsp>

These files will be converted into an internal format during the
MicroEJ Platform build.
