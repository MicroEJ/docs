=============
Low Level API
=============

Principle
=========

The MicroVG implementation for MicroEJ requires a Low Level implementation. 
The Low Level implementation consists of a set of header files to implement in C to target the hardware drivers.

For the simulator, the VG Pack's embedded Front Panel extension implements all MicroVG features.

   MicroVG Embedded Low Level API

The specification of header files names is:

- Name starts with ``LLVG_``.
- Second part name refers the VG engine: ``MATRIX``, ``PATH``, ``GRADIENT``, ``FONT``.
- All files name ends with ``_impl``:  all functions have to be implemented over hardware or in software.

A *master* header file initializes the native Vector Graphics engine: see :ref:`LLVG-API-SECTION`.
All other header files and their aims are described in next VG engines chapters:  :ref:`Matrix<section_vg_matrix_llapi>`, :ref:`Path<section_vg_path_llapi>`, :ref:`Gradient<section_vg_gradient_llapi>` and :ref:`Font<section_vg_font_llapi>`.

Simulator

   MicroVG Simulator Low Level API

In the simulator the four VG engines are grouped in a :ref:`Front Panel extension <section_ui_simulation>`. 

.. note:: The current implementation is built-in in the VG Pack and is only compatible with the i.MX RT595 MCU (see :ref:`VG Pack note<pack_vg>`).
