MicroEJ Architecture
====================

Introduction
============

MicroEJ Architecture features the MicroEJ Core Engine built for a specific instructions set (ISA) and compiler.

The MicroEJ Core Engine is a tiny and fast runtime associated with a Scheduler and a Garbage Collector. 

MicroEJ Architecture provides implementations of the following Foundation Libraries :

-  `EDC <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/edc/>`_: Embedded Device Configuration.
-  `BON <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/bon/>`_ Beyond Profile (see :ref:`[BON] <esr-specifications>`).
-  `SNI <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/sni/>`_ Simple Native Interface (:ref:`[SNI] <esr-specifications>`).
-  `SP <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/sni/>`_ Shielded Plug (:ref:`[SP] <esr-specifications>`).
-  `KF <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/sni/>`_ Kernel & Features (:ref:`[KF] <esr-specifications>`).

:ref:`The following figure <fig_jpf-runtime-components>` shows the components involved.

   MicroEJ Architecture Modules

Three Low Level APIs allow the MicroEJ Architecture to link with (and port
to) external code, such as any kind of RTOS or legacy C libraries: 

-  Simple Native Interface (see :ref:`[SNI] <esr-specifications>`)
-  Low Level MicroEJ Core Engine (see :ref:`LLMJVM <LLMJVM-API-SECTION>`)
-  Low Level Shielded Plug (see :ref:`LLSP <LLSP-API-SECTION>`)

Naming Convention
=================

MicroEJ Architecture files ends with the ``.xpf`` extension, and are classified using the following naming convention:

:: 

  com/microej/architecture/[ISA]/[TOOLCHAIN]/[UID]/[VERSION]/[UID]-[VERSION]-[USAGE].xpf

- ``ISA``: instruction set architecture (e.g. ``CM4`` for Arm速 Cortex速-M4, ``ESP32`` for Espressif ESP32, ...).
- ``TOOLCHAIN``: C compilation toolchain (e.g. ``CM4hardfp_GCC48``).
- ``UID``: Architecture unique ID (e.g. ``flopi4G25``).
- ``VERSION``: module version (e.g. ``7.12.0``).
- ``USAGE`` = ``eval`` for evaluation Architectures, ``prod`` for production Architectures.

For example, MicroEJ Architecture versions for Arm速 Cortex速-M4 microcontrollers compiled with GNU CC toolchain are available at
https://repository.microej.com/modules/com/microej/architecture/CM4/CM4hardfp_GCC48/flopi4G25/.

See :ref:`architecture_import` for usage.
