Principle
=========

The Font Engine is composed of:

* A "Font Designer" module: a graphical tool which runs within the MicroEJ IDE used to build and edit MicroUI fonts; it stores fonts in a platform-independent format. See :ref:`section.tool.fontdesigner`.
* A "Font Generator" module, for converting fonts from the platform-independent format into a platform-dependent format.
* The "Font Renderer" module which decodes and renders at application runtime the platform-dependent fonts files generated by the "Font Generator".

The three modules are complementary: a MicroUI font must be created and edited with the Font Designer before being integrated as a resource by the Font Generator. Finally the Font Renderer uses the generated fonts at runtime.

   Font Generation

Process overview:

1. User uses the Font Designer module to create a new font, and imports
   characters from system fonts (``*.ttf`` files) and / or user images
   (``*.png``, ``*.jpg``, ``*.bmp``, etc.).

2. Font Designer module saves the font as a MicroEJ Font (``*.ejf``
   file).

3. The user defines, in a text file, the fonts to load.

4. The Font Generator outputs a raw file for each font to convert (the
   raw format is display device-dependent).

5. The raw files are embedded as (hidden) resources within the MicroEJ
   Application. The raw files' data are linked into the FLASH memory.

6. When the MicroEJ Application creates a MicroUI Font object
   which targets a pre-generated image, the Font Engine Core only has to
   link from the MicroUI Font object to the data in the FLASH
   memory. Therefore, the loading is very fast; only the font data from
   the FLASH memory is used: no copy of the font data is sent to RAM
   memory first.
