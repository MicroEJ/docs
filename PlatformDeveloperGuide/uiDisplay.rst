Display

Principle
=========

The Display engine contains the C part of the MicroUI implementation which manages graphical displays. This module is composed of three elements:

- the C part of MicroUI Display API (a built-in C archive)
- an implementation of a low level API for the displays (LLUI_DISPLAY) that the BSP must provide (see :ref:`LLDISPLAY-API-SECTION`)
- an implementation of a low level API for MicroUI drawings


Functional Description
======================

The Display engine (or graphical engine) implements the MicroUI graphics framework. This framework is constitued of several notions: the display characteristics (size, format, backlight, contrast etc.), the drawing state machine (render, flush, wait flush completed), the images cycle life, the font and drawings. The main part of graphical engine is provided by a built-in C archive. This library manages the drawing state machine mechanism, the images and fonts. The display characteristics and the drawings are managed by the ``LLUI_DISPLAY`` implementation.   

Graphical engine is designed to let the BSP use an optional graphics processor unit (GPU) or an optional third-party drawing library. Each drawing can be implemented independantly; no have to implement all MicroUI drawings. If no extra framework is available, the graphical engine performs all drawings in software. In this case the graphical engine low-level implementation the BSP has to perform is very simple (four functions). 

MicroUI library also gives the possibility to perform some additional drawings which are not available as API in MicroUI library. Graphical engine gives a set of functions to synchronize the drawings between them, to get the destination (and sometimes source) characteristics, to call internal software drawings etc. 

Front Panel (simulator display engine part) gives the same possibilities. Same constraints can be applied, same drawings can be overrided or added, same software drawing rendering is performed (down to the pixel).

.. _section_display_modes:

Display Configurations
======================

The Display engine provides a number of different configurations. The appropriate configuration should be selected depending on the capabilities of the screen and other related hardware, such as LCD controllers.

The modes can vary in three ways:

-  the buffer mode: double-buffer, simple buffer (also known as *direct*)
-  the memory layout of the pixels
-  pixel format or depth

The supplied configurations offer a limited range of combinations of the options.

Buffer Modes
============

Overview
--------

When using the double buffering technique, the memory into which the application draws (called graphics buffer or back buffer) is not the memory used by the screen to refresh it (called frame buffer or display
buffer). When everything has been drawn consistently from the application point of view, the back buffer contents are synchronized with the display buffer. Double buffering avoids flickering and inconsistent rendering: it is well suited to high quality animations.

For more static display-based applications, and/or to save memory, an alternative configuration is to use only one buffer, shared by both the application and the screen.

Displays addressed by one of the standard configurations are called *generic displays*. For these generic displays, there are three buffer modes: switch, copy and direct. The following flow chart provides a
handy guide to selecting the appropriate buffer mode according to the hardware configuration.

   Buffer Modes

Implementation
--------------

The display engine does not depend on type of buffer mode. At the end of a drawing, the display engine calls the LLAPI ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_flush`` to let the implementation to update the LCD data. This function should be atomic and the implementation has to return the new graphics buffer address (back buffer address). In
``direct`` and ``copy`` modes, this address never changes and the implementation has always to return the back buffer address. In ``switch`` mode, the implementation has to return the old LCD frame buffer address.

The next sections describe the work to do for each mode.

.. _switchBufferMode:

Switch
------

The switch mode is a double-buffered mode where two buffers in RAM alternately play the role of the back buffer and the display buffer. The display source is alternatively changed from one buffer to the other. Switching the source address may be done asynchronously. The synchronize function is called before starting the next set of draw operations, and must wait until the driver has switched to the new buffer.

Synchronization steps are described :ref:`below <switchModeSyncSteps>`.

.. _switchModeSyncSteps :

- | *Step 1:* Drawing
  | MicroUI is drawing in buffer 0 (back buffer) and the display is reading its contents from buffer 1 (display buffer).

.. figure:: images/switch-step1.*
   :alt: Step 1 : Drawing
   :width: 284px
   :height: 160px
   :align: center

- | *Step 2:* Switch
  | The drawing is done. Set that the next read will be done from buffer 0.
  | Note that the display \"hardware component\" asynchronously continues to read data from buffer 1.

.. figure:: images/switch-step2.*
   :alt: Step 2 : Switch
   :width: 284px
   :height: 160px
   :align: center

- | *Step 3:* Copy
  | A copy from the buffer 0 (new display buffer) to the buffer 1 (new back buffer) must be done to keep the contents of the current drawing. The copy routine must wait until the display has finished the switch, and start asynchronously by comparison with the MicroUI drawing routine (see next step). 
  | This copy routine can be done in a dedicated RTOS task or in an interrupt routine. The copy should start after the display \"hardware component\" has finished a full buffer read to avoid flickering.
  | Usually a tearing signal from the LCD at the end of the  read of the previous buffer (buffer 1) or at the beginning of the read of the new buffer (buffer 0) throws an interrupt. The interrupt routine starts the copy using a DMA.
  | If it is not possible to start an asynchronous copy, the copy must be performed in the MicroUI drawing routine, at the beginning of the next step.
  | Note that the copy is partial: only the parts that have changed need to be copied, lowering the CPU load.

.. figure:: images/switch-step3.*
   :alt: Step 3 : Copy
   :width: 284px
   :height: 160px
   :align: center

- | *Step 4:* Synchronisation
  | Waits until the copy routine has finished the full copy.
  | If the copy has not been done asynchronously, the copy must start after the display has finished the switch. It is a blocking copy because the next drawing operation has to wait until this copy is done.

- | *Step 5:* Next draw operation
  | Same behavior as step 1 with buffers reversed.

   :align: center


.. _copyBufferMode:

Copy
----

The copy mode is a double-buffered mode where the back buffer is in RAM and has a fixed address. To update the display, data is sent to the display buffer. This can be done either by a memory copy or by sending
bytes using a bus, such as SPI or I2C.

Synchronization steps are described :ref:`below <table_copyModeSyncSteps>`.

.. _table_copyModeSyncSteps:

- | *Step 1:* Drawing 
  | MicroUI is drawing in the back buffer and the display is reading its content from the display buffer.

.. image:: images/copy-step1.*
   :width: 284px
   :height: 160px
   :align: center

- | *Step 2:* Copy 
  | The drawing is done. A copy from the back buffer to the display buffer is triggered. 
  | Note that the implementation of the copy operation may be done asynchronously – it is recommended to wait until the display "hardware component" has finished a full buffer read to avoid flickering. At the implementation level, the copy may be done by a DMA, a dedicated RTOS task, interrupt, etc.

.. image:: images/copy-step2.*
   :width: 284px
   :height: 160px
   :align: center

- | *Step 3:*  Synchronization
  | The next drawing operation waits until the copy is complete.

   :align: center

.. _directBufferMode:

Direct
------

The direct mode is a single-buffered mode where the same memory area is used for the back buffer and the display buffer (:ref:`See illustration below <fig_directMode>`). Use of the direct mode is likely to
result in "noisy" rendering and flickering, but saves one buffer in runtime memory.

.. _section_display_layout_byte:

Byte Layout
===========

This chapter concerns only LCD with a number of bits-per-pixel (BPP) smaller than 8. For this kind of LCD, a byte contains several pixels and the display module allows to customize how to organize the pixels in a
byte.

Two layouts are available:

-  line: The byte contains several consecutive pixels on same line. When the end of line is reatched, a padding is added in order to start a new line with a new byte.
-  column: The byte contains several consecutive pixels on same column. When the end of column is reatched, a padding is added in order to start a new column with a new byte.

When installing the display module, a property ``byteLayout`` is required to specify the kind of pixels representation (see :ref:`section_display_installation`).

.. _section_display_layout_memory:

Memory Layout
=============

For the LCD with a number of bits-per-pixel (BPP) higher or equal to 8, the display module supports the line-by-line memory organization: pixels are laid out from left to right within a line, starting with the top
line. For a display with 16 bits-per-pixel, the pixel at (0,0) is stored at memory address 0, the pixel at (1,0) is stored at address 2, the pixel at (2,0) is stored at address 4, and so on.

For the LCD with a number of bits-per-pixel (BPP) lower than 8, the display module supports the both memory organizations: line by line (pixels are laid out from left to right within a line, starting with the top line) and column by column (pixels are laid out from top to bottom within a line, starting with the left line). These byte organizations concern until 8 consecutive pixels (see :ref:`section_display_layout_byte`). When installing the display module, a property ``memoryLayout`` is required to specify the kind of pixels representation (see :ref:`section_display_installation`).

.. _display_pixel_structure:

Pixel Structure
===============

The Display module provides pre-built display configurations with standard pixel memory layout. The layout of the bits within the pixel may be standard (see MicroUI GraphicsContext pixel formats) or driver-specific. When installing the display module, a property ``bpp`` is required to specify the kind of pixel representation (see :ref:`section_display_installation`).

When the value is one among this list: ``ARGB8888 | RGB888 | RGB565 | ARGB1555 | ARGB4444 | C4 | C2 | C1``, the display module considers the LCD pixels representation as standard. According to the chosen format, some color data can be lost or cropped.

When the value is one among this list: ``1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 24 | 32``, the display module considers the LCD pixel representation as generic but not standard. In this case, the driver must implement functions that
convert MicroUI's standard 32 bits ARGB colors to LCD color representation (see :ref:`LLDISPLAY-API-SECTION`). This mode is often used when the pixel representation is not ``ARGB`` or ``RGB`` but ``BGRA`` or ``BGR`` instead. This mode can also be used when the number of bits for a color component (alpha, red, green or blue) is not standard or when the value does not represent a color but an index in an LUT.

Low-Level API
=============

Overview
--------

.. figure:: images/ui_llapi_display.*
   :alt: MicroUI Display Low-Level
   :width: 70%

* MicroUI library `talks` with BSP through the graphical engine and header file ``LLUI_DISPLAY_impl.h``. 
* Implementation of ``LLUI_DISPLAY_impl.h`` can `talk` with graphical engine through ``LLUI_DISPLAY.h``.
* To perform some drawings, MicroUI uses ``LLUI_PAINTER_impl.h`` functions.
* The drawing native functions are implemented in the CCO ``com.microej.clibrary.llimpl#microui-drawings``; this CCO must be included in BSP.
* This CCO redirects drawings the implementation of ``ui_drawing.h``.
* ``ui_drawing.h`` is already implemented by `software algorithms` library (not represented in previous picture).
* ``ui_drawing.h`` can be too implemented in BSP to use a GPU for instance.
* This Implementation is allowed to call `software algorithms` through ``ui_drawing_soft.h`` header file.
* MicroEJ library ``Drawing`` performs same operations with header files ``LLDW_PAINTER_impl.h``, ``dw_drawing_impl.h`` and ``dw_drawing.h``; and with C file ``LLDW_PAINTER_impl.c`` also available in CCO ``com.microej.clibrary.llimpl#microui-drawings``.

Required Low Level API
----------------------

Some four low-level APIs are required to connect the display engine on the LCD driver. The functions are listed in ``LLUI_DISPLAY_impl.h``. 

* ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_initialize`` : The initialization function is called when MicroEJ application is calling ``MicroUI.start()``. Before this call, the LCD is useless and no need to be initialized. This function consists to initialize the LCD driver and to fill the given structure ``LLUI_DISPLAY_SInitData``.  This structure has to contain pointers on two binary semaphores (see after), the back buffer address (see :ref:`section_display_modes`), the LCD *virtual* size in pixels and optionaly the LCD *physical* size in pixels.
 The LCD *virtual* size is the size of the area where the drawings are visible. The LCD *physical* size is the required memory size where the area is located. Theoretical memory size is: ``lcd_width * lcd_height * bpp / 8``. On some devices the memory width (in pixels) is higher than virtual width. In this way, the graphics buffer memory size is: ``memory_width * memory_height * bpp / 8``.

* ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_binarySemaphoreTake`` and ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_binarySemaphoreGive``: The display engine requires two binary semaphores to synchronize its internal states. The binary semaphores must be configured in a state such that the semaphore must first be *given* before it can be *taken*. Two distincts functions have to be implemented to *take* and *give* a binary semaphore.

* ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_flush``: According the display buffer mode (see :ref:`section_display_modes`), the ``flush`` function has to be implemented. This function should be atomic and not performing the copy directly. Another OS task or a dedicated hardware must be configured to perform the buffer copy. 

Optional Low Level API
----------------------

Several low-level API are available in ``LLUI_DISPLAY_impl.h``. They are already implemented as *weak* functions in the display engine and return no error. These optional features concern the LCD backlight and constrast, LCD characteristics (is colored display, double buffer), colors conversions (see :ref:`display_pixel_structure` and :ref:`display_lut`) etc.

Painter Low Level API
---------------------

All MicroUI drawings (available in ``Painter`` class) are calling a native function. The MicroUI native drawing functions are listed in ``LLUI_PAINTER_impl.h``. The implementation must take care about a lot of constraints: synchronization between drawings, graphical engine notification, MicroUI ``GraphicsContext`` clip and colors, flush dirty area etc. The principle of implementing a MicroUI drawing function is described in the chapter :ref:`display_drawing_native`. 

An implementation of ``LLUI_PAINTER_impl.h`` is already available on MicroEJ Central Repository. This implementation respects the synchronization between drawings, the graphical engine notification, reduce (when possible) the MicroUI ``GraphicsContext`` clip constraints and update (when possible) the flush dirty area. This implementation does not perform the drawings. It only calls the equivalent of drawing available in ``ui_drawing.h``. This allows to simplify how to use a GPU (or a third-party library) to perform a drawing: the ``ui_drawing.h`` implementation has just to take in consideration the  MicroUI ``GraphicsContext`` clip and colors and flush dirty area. Synchronization with the graphical engine is already performed.

In addition with the implementation of ``LLUI_PAINTER_impl.h``, an implementation of ``ui_drawing.h`` is already available in graphical engine (in *weak* mode). This allows to implement only the functions the GPU is able to perform. For a given drawing, the weak function implementation is calling the equivalent of drawing available in ``ui_drawing_soft.h``. This file lists all drawing functions implemented by the graphical engine.

The graphical engine implementation of ``ui_drawing_soft.h`` is performing the drawings in software. However some drawings can call another ``ui_drawing.h`` function. For instance ``UI_DRAWING_SOFT_drawHorizontalLine`` is calling ``UI_DRAWING_fillRectangle`` in order to use a GPU if available. If not available, the weak implementation of ``UI_DRAWING_fillRectangle`` is calling ``UI_DRAWING_SOFT_fillRectangle`` and so on.

The BSP implementation is also allowed to call ``ui_drawing_soft.h`` algorithms, one or several times per function to implement. For instance, a GPU may be able to draw an image whose format is RGB565. But if the image format is ARGB1555, BSP implementation can call ``UI_DRAWING_SOFT_drawImage`` function.

Graphical Engine API
--------------------

Graphical engine provides a set of functions to interact with the C archive. Thes functions allows to retrieve some drawing characteristics, synchronize drawings between them, notify the end of flush and drawings etc. 

The functions are available in ``LLUI_DISPLAY.h``. 

.. _display_drawing_native:

Drawing Native
==============

As explained upper, MicroUI implementation provides a dedicated header file which lists all MicroUI Painter drawings native function. The implementation of these functions has to respect several rules to not corrupt the MicroUI execution (flickering, memory corruption, unknown behavior etc.). These rules are already respected in the CCO available in MicroEJ Central Repository. In addition, MicroUI allows to add some custom drawings. The implementation of MicroUI Painter native drawings should be used as model to implement the custom drawings.

All native functions must have a ``MICROUI_GraphicsContext*`` as parameter (often first parameter). This identifies the destination target: the MicroUI ``GraphicsContext``. This target is retrieved in MicroEJ application calling the method ``GraphicsContext.getSNIContext()``. This method returns a byte array which is directly mapped on the ``MICROUI_GraphicsContext`` structure in MicroUI native drawing function declaration.
 
A graphics context holds a clip and the drawer is not allowed to perform a drawing outside this clip (otherwise the behavior is unknown). Note the bottom-right coordinates might be smaller than top-left (in x and/or y) when the clip width and/or height is null. The clip may be disabled (when the current drawing fits the clip); this allows to reduce runtime. See ``LLUI_DISPLAY_isClipEnabled()``.

.. note::

   Several clip functions are available in ``LLUI_DISPLAY.h`` to check if a drawing fits the clip.

Graphical engine requires the synchronization between the drawing. To do that, it requires a call to ``LLUI_DISPLAY_requestDrawing`` at the beginning of native function implementation. This function takes as parameter the graphics context and the pointer on the native function itself. This pointer must be casted in a ``SNI_callback``. 

The drawing function must update the next ``Display.flush()`` area (dirty area). If not performed, the next call to ``Display.flush()`` will not call ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_flush()`` function.
 
The native function implementation pattern is:

.. code:: c

   void Java_com_mycompany_MyPainterClass_myDrawingNative(MICROUI_GraphicsContext* gc, ...)
   {
      // tell to graphical engine if drawing can be performed
      if (LLUI_DISPLAY_requestDrawing(gc, (SNI_callback)&Java_com_mycompany_MyPainterClass_myDrawingNative))
      {
         DRAWING_Status status;

         // perform the drawings (respecting clip if not disabled)
         [...]

         // update new flush dirty area
         LLUI_DISPLAY_setDrawingLimits(gc, ...);

         // set drawing status
         LLUI_DISPLAY_setDrawingStatus(DRAWING_DONE); // or DRAWING_RUNNING;
      }
      // else: refused drawing
   }

Display Synchronization
=======================

Overview
--------

Graphical engine is designed to be synchronized with the LCD refresh rate by defining some points in the rendering timeline. It is optional; however it is mainly recommanded.  This chapter explains why to use LCD tearing signal and its consequences. Some chronograms describe several use cases: with and without LCD tearing signal, long drawings, long flush time etc. Times are in milliseconds. To simplify chronograms views, the LCD refresh rate is every 16ms (62.5Hz). 

Captions definition:

* UI: It is the UI task which performs the drawings in the back buffer. At the end of drawing, the examples consider the UI thread calls ``Display.flush()`` 1 millisecond after the end of drawing. At this moment, a flush can start (the call to ``Display.flush()`` is symbolized by a simple `peak` in chronograms).
* Flush: In :ref:`copy<copyBufferMode>` mode, it is the time to transfer the content of back buffer to display buffer. In :ref:`switch<switchBufferMode>` mode, it is the time to swap back and display buffers (often instantaneous) and the time to recopy the content of new display buffer to new back buffer. During this time, the back buffer is `in use` and UI task has to wait the end of copy before starting a new drawing. 
* Tearing: The peaks show the tearing signals.
* Rendering frequency: the frequency between the start of a drawing to the end of flush.

Tearing Signal
--------------

In this example, the drawing time is 7ms, the time between end of drawing and call to ``Display.flush()`` is 1ms and the flush time is 6ms. So the expected rendering frequency is 7 + 1 + 6 = 14ms. Flush starts just after the call to ``Display.flush()`` and the next drawing starts just after the end of flush. Tearing signal is not taken in consideration. By consequence the LCD content is refreshed during the LCD refresh time. The content can be corrupted: flickering, glitches etc. The rendering frequency is faster than LCD refresh rate.

.. figure:: images/uiDisplaySync01.*
   :width: 100%

In this example, the times are identical to previous example. The tearing signal is used to start the flush in respecting the LCD refreshing time. The rendering frequency becomes smaller: it is cadenced on the tearing signal, every 16ms. During 2ms, the CPU can schedule other tasks or goes in idle mode. The rendering frequency is equal to LCD refresh rate.

.. figure:: images/uiDisplaySync02.*
   :width: 100%

In this example, the drawing time is 14ms, the time between end of drawing and call to ``Display.flush()`` is 1ms and the flush time is 6ms. So the expected rendering frequency is 14 + 1 + 6 = 21ms. Flush starts just after the call to ``Display.flush()`` and the next drawing starts just after the end of flush. Tearing signal is not taken in consideration. The rendering frequency is higher than LCD refresh rate.

.. figure:: images/uiDisplaySync03.*
   :width: 100%
 
In this example, the times are identical to previous example. The tearing signal is used to start the flush in respecting the LCD refreshing time. The drawing time + flush time is higher than LCD tearing signal period. So the flush cannot start at every tearing peak: it is cadenced on two tearing signals, every 32ms. During 11ms, the CPU can schedule other tasks or goes in idle mode. The rendering frequency is equal to LCD refresh rate divided by two.

.. figure:: images/uiDisplaySync04.*
   :width: 100%

Additional Buffer 
-----------------

Some devices take a lot of time to send back buffer content to display buffer. The following examples demonstrate the consequence on rendering frequency. The use of an additional buffer optimizes this frequency, however it uses a lot of RAM memory.

In this example, the drawing time is 5ms, the time between end of drawing and call to ``Display.flush()`` is 1ms and the flush time is 14ms. So the expected rendering frequency is 5 + 1 + 14 = 20ms. Flush starts just after the call to ``Display.flush()`` and the next drawing starts just after the end of flush. Tearing signal is not taken in consideration. The rendering frequency is cadenced on drawing time + flush time.

.. figure:: images/uiDisplaySync05.*
   :width: 100%

As mentionned upper, the idea is to use two back buffers. First, UI task is drawing in back buffer ``A``. Just after the call to ``Display.flush()``, the flush can start. At same moment, the content of back buffer ``A`` is copied in back buffer ``B``. During the flush time (copy of back buffer ``A`` to display buffer), the back buffer ``B`` can be used by UI task to continue the drawings. When drawings in back buffer ``B`` are done (and after call to ``Display.flush()``), the DMA copy of back buffer ``B`` to back buffer ``A`` cannot start: the copy can only start when the flush is fully done because the flush is using the back buffer ``A``. As soon as the flush is done, a new flush (and DMA copy) can start. The rendering frequency is cadenced on flush time.

.. figure:: images/uiDisplaySync06.*
   :width: 100%

The previous example doesn't take in consideration the LCD tearing signal. However this technique of double back buffers is not efficient when tearing signal is used. The flush cannot start until tearing signal. During this waiting time, DMA copy and next drawing can be done or started. As soon as the drawing is done (and after call to ``Display.flush()``), the UI task has to wait the end of flush (which has started in late). By consequence, the rendering frequency is cadenced on two LCD tearing signals. 

.. figure:: images/uiDisplaySync07.*
   :width: 100%

GPU Synchronization
===================

When a GPU is used to perform a drawing, the caller (MicroUI painter native method) returns immediately. This allows to the MicroEJ application to perform other operations during the GPU rendering. However, as soon as the MicroEJ application is trying to perform another drawing, the previous drawing made by the GPU must be done. Graphical engine is designed to be synchronized with the GPU asynchronous drawings by defining some points in the rendering timeline. It is not optional: MicroUI considers a drawing is fully done when it starts a new one. The end of GPU drawing must notify the graphical engine calling ``LLUI_DISPLAY_drawingDone()``.

Antialiasing
============

Fonts
-----

The antialiasing mode for the fonts concerns only the fonts with more than 1 bit per pixel (see :ref:`section_fontgen`).

Background Color
----------------

For each pixel to draw, the antialiasing process blends the foreground color with a background color. This background color is static or dynamic:

-  static: The background color is fixed by the MicroEJ Application  (``GraphicsContext.setBackgroundColor()``).
-  dynamic: The background color is the original color of the  destination pixel (a "read pixel" operation is performed for each pixel).

Note that the dynamic mode is slower than the static mode.


.. _display_lut:

LUT
===

The display module allows to target LCD which uses a pixel indirection table (LUT). This kind of LCD are considered as generic but not standard (see :ref:`display_pixel_structure`). By consequence, the driver must implement functions that convert MicroUI's standard 32 bits ARGB colors (see :ref:`LLDISPLAY-API-SECTION`) to LCD color representation. For each application ARGB8888 color, the display driver has to find the corresponding color in the table. The display module will store the index of the color in the table instead of using the color itself.

When an application color is not available in the display driver table (LUT), the display driver can try to find the nearest color or return a default color. First solution is often quite difficult to write and can cost a lot of time at runtime. That's why the second solution is preferred. However, a consequence is that  he application has only to use a range of colors provided by the display driver.

MicroUI and the display module uses blending when drawing some texts or anti-aliased shapes. For each pixel to draw, the display stack blends the current application foreground color with the targeted pixel current color or with the current application background color (when enabled). This blending *creates* some  intermediate colors which are managed by the display driver. Most of time the default color will be returned and so the rendering will be wrong. To prevent this use case, the display module offers a specific LLAPI ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_prepareBlendingOfIndexedColors(void* foreground, void* background)``. This API is only used when a blending is required and when the background color is enabled. Display module calls the API just before the blending and gives as parameter the pointers on the both ARGB colors. The display driver should replace the ARGB colors by the LUT indexes. Then the display module will only use the indexes between the
both indexes. For instance, when the returned indexes are ``20`` and ``27``, the display stack will use the indexes ``20`` to ``27``, where all indexes between ``20`` and ``27`` target some intermediate colors between the both original ARGB colors. 

This solution requires several conditions:

-  Background color is enabled and it is an available color in the LUT.
-  Application can only use foreground colors provided by the LUT. The platform designer should give to the application developer the available list of colors the LUT manages.
-  The LUT must provide a set blending ranges the application can use. Each range can have its own size (different number of colors between two colors). Each range is independent. For instance if the foreground color ``RED`` (``0xFFFF0000``) can be blended with two background colors ``WHITE`` (``0xFFFFFFFF``) and ``BLACK`` (``0xFF000000``), two ranges must be provided. The both ranges have to contain the same index for the color ``RED``.
-  Application can only use blending ranges provided by the LUT. Otherwise the display driver is not able to find the range and the default color will be used to perform the blending.
-  Rendering of dynamic images (images decoded at runtime) may be wrong because the ARGB colors may be out of LUT range.


Image Pixel Conversion
======================

Overview
--------

Display engine is built for a dedicated LCD pixel format (see :ref:`display_pixel_structure`). For this pixel format, the display engine must be able to draw image with or without alpha blending and with or without transformation. In addition, it must be able to read all images formats.

The MicroEJ application may not use all MicroUI image drawings options and may not use all images formats. It is not possible to detect what the application is needed, so no optimization can be performed at application compiletime. However, for a given application, the platform can be built with a reduced set of pixel support. 

All pixel format manipulations (read, write, copy) are using dedicated functions. It is possible to remove some functions or to use generic functions. The advantage is to reduce the memory footprint. The inconvenient is that some features are removed (the application should not use them) or some features are slower (generic functions are slower than dedicated functions).

Functions
---------

There are five pixel *conversion* modes:

-  draw an image without transformation and without global alpha blending: copy a pixel from a format to the destination format (LCD format)
-  draw an image without transformation and with global alpha blending: copy a pixel with alpha blending from a format to the destination format (LCD format)
-  draw an image with transformation and with or without alpha blending: draw an ARGB8888 pixel in destination format (LCD format)
-  load a ``ResourceImage`` with an output format: convert an ARGB8888 pixel to the output format
-  read a pixel from an image (``Image.readPixel()`` or to draw an image with transformation or to convert an image): read any pixel formats and convert it in ARGB8888

   +------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

There are ``22x1 + 22x1 + 2x1 + 1x6 + 22x1 = 74`` functions. Each function takes between 50 and 200 bytes according the complexity and the C compiler. 

Linker File
-----------

All pixel functions are listed in a platform linker file. It is possible to edit this file to remove some features or to share some functions (using generic function).

How to get the file:

#. Build platform as usual.
#. Copy platform file ``[platform]/source/link/display_image_x.lscf`` in platform configuration project: ``[platform configuration project]/dropins/link/``. ``x`` is a number which characterizes the display pixel format (see :ref:`display_pixel_structure`). See next warning.
#. Perform some changes into the copied file (see after).
#. Rebuild the platform: the `dropins` file is copied in the platform instead of the original one.

.. warning:: When the display format in ``[platform configuration project]/display/display.properties`` changes, the linker file suffix changes too. Perform again all operations in new file with new suffix.

The linker files holds five tables, one for each use case, respectively ``IMAGE_UTILS_TABLE_COPY``, ``IMAGE_UTILS_TABLE_COPY_WITH_ALPHA``, ``IMAGE_UTILS_TABLE_DRAW``, ``IMAGE_UTILS_TABLE_SET`` and ``IMAGE_UTILS_TABLE_READ``. For each table, a comment describe how to remove an option (when possible) or how to replace an option by a generic function (if available). 

Library ej.apiDrawing
=====================

This library is a foundation library which provides additional drawings API. MicroUI's drawing APIs are `aliased` oriented whereas Drawing's drawing APIs are `anti-aliased` oriented. This library is fully integrated in graphical engine. It requires an implementation of its low-level API: ``LLDW_PAINTER_impl.h``. These functions are implemented in the same CCO than ``LLUI_PAINTER_impl.h``: ``com.microej.clibrary.llimpl#microui-drawings``. Like MicroUI painter's natives, the functions are redirected to ``dw_drawing.h``. A default implementation of these functions are available in Software Algorithms module (in weak). This allows to the BSP to override one or several APIs.

Dependencies
============

-  MicroUI initialization step (see :ref:`section_static_init`).

-  MicroUI C libraries (see :ref:`section_architecture`).



.. _section_display_implementation:

Implementations
===============

The implementation of the MicroUI ``Display`` API targets a generic
display (see :ref:`section_display_modes`): Switch, Copy and Direct.
It provides some low level API. The BSP has to implement these LLAPI,
making the link between the MicroUI C library ``display`` and the BSP
display driver. The LLAPI to implement are listed in the header file
``LLUI_DISPLAY_impl.h``.

When there is no display on the board, a *stub* implementation of C
library is available. This C library must be linked by the third-party C
IDE when MicroUI module is installed in the MicroEJ Platform.


Dependencies
============

-  MicroUI module (see :ref:`section_microui`)

-  ``LLUI_DISPLAY_impl.h`` implementation if standard or custom
   implementation is chosen (see
   :ref:`section_display_implementation` and
   :ref:`LLDISPLAY-API-SECTION`).


.. _section_display_installation:

Installation
============

Display is a sub-part of the MicroUI library. When the MicroUI module is
installed, the Display module must be installed in order to be able to
connect the physical display with the MicroEJ Platform. If not
installed, the *stub* module will be used.

In the platform configuration file, check :guilabel:`UI` > :guilabel:`Display` to
install the Display module. When checked, the properties file
:guilabel:`display` > :guilabel:`display.properties` is required during platform creation to
configure the module. This configuration step is used to choose the kind
of implementation (see :ref:`section_display_implementation`).

The properties file must / can contain the following properties:

-  ``bpp`` [mandatory]: Defines the number of bits per pixels the
   display device is using to render a pixel. Expected value is one
   among these both list:

   Standard formats:

   -  ``ARGB8888``: Alpha 8 bits; Red 8 bits; Green 8 bits; Blue 8 bits

   -  ``RGB888``: Alpha 0 bit; Red 8 bits; Green 8 bits; Blue 8 bits
      (fully opaque)

   -  ``RGB565``: Alpha 0 bit; Red 5 bits; Green 6 bits; Blue 5 bits
      (fully opaque)

   -  ``ARGB1555``: Alpha 1 bit; Red 5 bits; Green 5 bits; Blue 5 bits
      (fully opaque or fully transparent)

   -  ``ARGB4444``: Alpha 4 bits; Red 4 bits; Green 4 bits; Blue 4 bits

   -  ``C4``: 4 bits to encode linear grayscale colors between
      0xff000000 and 0xffffffff (fully opaque)

   -  ``C2``: 2 bits to encode linear grayscale colors between
      0xff000000 and 0xffffffff (fully opaque)

   -  ``C1``: 1 bit to encode grayscale colors 0xff000000 and 0xffffffff
      (fully opaque)

   Custom formats:

   -  ``32``: until 32 bits to encode Alpha, Red, Green and/or Blue

   -  ``24``: until 24 bits to encode Alpha, Red, Green and/or Blue

   -  ``16``: until 16 bits to encode Alpha, Red, Green and/or Blue

   -  ``8``: until 8 bits to encode Alpha, Red, Green and/or Blue

   -  ``4``: until 4 bits to encode Alpha, Red, Green and/or Blue

   -  ``2``: until 2 bits to encode Alpha, Red, Green and/or Blue

   -  ``1``: 1 bit to encode Alpha, Red, Green or Blue

   All others values are forbidden (throw a generation error).

-  ``byteLayout`` [optional, default value is "line"]: Defines the
   pixels data order in a byte the display device is using. A byte can
   contain several pixels when the number of bits-per-pixels (see 'bpp'
   property) is lower than 8. Otherwise this property is useless. Two
   modes are available: the next bit(s) on same byte can target the next
   pixel on same line or on same column. In first case, when the end of
   line is reatched, the next byte contains the first pixels of next
   line. In second case, when the end of column is reatched, the next
   byte contains the first pixels of next column. In both cases, a new
   line or a new column restarts with a new byte, even if it remains
   some free bits in previous byte.

   -  ``line``: the next bit(s) on current byte contains the next pixel
      on same line (x increment)

   -  ``column``: the next bit(s) on current byte contains the next
      pixel on same column (y increment)

   .. note::

      -  Default value is 'line'.

      -  All others modes are forbidden (throw a generation error).

      -  When the number of bits-per-pixels (see 'bpp' property) is
         higher or equal than 8, this property is useless and ignored.

-  ``memoryLayout`` [optional, default value is "line"]: Defines the
   pixels data order in memory the display device is using. This option
   concerns only the LCD with a bpp lower than 8 (see 'bpp' property).
   Two modes are available: when the byte memory address is incremented,
   the next targeted group of pixels is the next group on the same line
   or the next group on same column. In first case, when the end of line
   is reached, the next group of pixels is the first group of next line.
   In second case, when the end of column is reached, the next group of
   pixels is the first group of next column.

   -  ``line``: the next memory address targets the next group of pixels
      on same line (x increment)

   -  ``column``: the next memory address targets the next group of
      pixels on same column (y increment)

   .. note::

      -  Default value is 'line'.

      -  All others modes are forbidden (throw a generation error).

      -  When the number of bits-per-pixels (see 'bpp' property) is
         higher or equal than 8, this property is useless and ignored.
