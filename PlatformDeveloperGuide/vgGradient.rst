Principle
=========

The Gradient module contains the C part of the MicroVG implementation which manages linear gradients.
This module is composed of only one element: an implementation of the Low Level APIs to create gradient elements compatible with the hardware.

.. _section_vg_gradient_implementation:

Functional Description
======================

The Gradient module implements the MicroVG `LinearGradient <zzz_javadocurl_zzz/ej/microvg/LinearGradient.html>`_ framework. 
It provides Low Level APIs that consist to create a linear gradient in platform specific format. 
After the gradient creation and encoding, the gradient data should not change when the application draws it: the encoded format should be the one used by the GPU.

A linear gradient is a succession of colors at different positions.
The colors are encoded in 32-bit format: ARGB8888.

The buffer where the gradient is encoded is stored in the Java heap.
The buffer size is automatically increased by the MicroVG implementation on demand.

Low Level API
=============

The Low Level APIs to implement are listed in the header file ``LLVG_GRADIENT_impl.h`` (see :ref:`LLVG-GRADIENT-API-SECTION`):
