Gradient

Principle
=========

The Gradient module contains the C part of the MicroVG implementation which manages linear gradients.
This module is composed of only one element: an implementation of the Low Level APIs to create gradient elements compatible with the hardware.

.. _section_vg_gradient_implementation:

Functional Description
======================

The Gradient module implements the MicroVG `LinearGradient <zzz_javadocurl_zzz/ej/microvg/LinearGradient.html>`_ framework. 
It provides Low Level APIs that consist in creating a linear gradient in platform specific format. 
After the gradient creation and encoding, the gradient data should not change when the application draws it: the encoded format should be the one used by the platform specific implementation (generally GPU).

A linear gradient is a succession of colors at different positions.
The colors from the MicroVG library implementation are encoded in 32-bit format: ARGB8888.
The color encoding in the gradient is platform specific implementation.

The buffer where the gradient is encoded is stored in the Java heap.
The buffer size is automatically increased by the MicroVG implementation on demand.

Low Level API
=============

The low level APIs that have to be implemented are listed in the header file ``LLVG_GRADIENT_impl.h`` (see :ref:`LLVG-GRADIENT-API-SECTION`):

   Gradient Low Level API

* MicroVG library calls the BSP functions through the header files ``LLVG_GRADIENT_impl.h``, ``LLVG_PATH_PAINTER_impl.h`` and  ``LLVG_FONT_PAINTER_impl.h``.
* The :ref:`C module MicroVG <section_vg_c_module_microvg>` provides a default implementation of ``LLVG_GRADIENT_impl.h``: it manages the gradient buffer creation and filling, then redirect the gradient encoding to ``microvg_gradient.h``.
* The :ref:`C module MicroVG-VGLte <section_vg_c_module_microvg>` provides an implementation of ``LLVG_PATH_PAINTER_impl.h``, ``LLVG_FONT_PAINTER_impl.h`` and ``microvg_gradient.h``: it encodes the gradient and implements the drawings over the Vivante VGLite library and Freetype.
* These files are automatically copied in the BSP project when fetching the C modules during the platform build.
