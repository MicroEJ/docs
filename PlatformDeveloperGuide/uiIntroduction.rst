The User Interface Extension features one of the fastest graphical engines, associated with a unique int-based event management system. It provides :ref:`[MUI] library <esr-specifications>` implementation. 

The diagram below shows a simplified view of the components involved in the provisioning of User Interface Extension.

   Overview

Display, Input and LED are called X engine (respectively Graphical engine, Input engine and LED engine). These three low level parts connect MicroUI library to the user-supplied drivers code (coded in C). The drivers can use hardware accelerators like DMA and GPU to perform some actions (buffers copy, drawings etc.).

The MicroEJ Simulator provides all features of MicroUI library. The three engines are grouped together in a module called Front Panel. The Front Panel is supplied with a set of software widgets that generically support a range of input devices, such as buttons, joysticks and touchscreens, and output devices such as displays and LEDs. With the help of the Front Panel Designer tool that forms part of the MicroEJ Workbench the user must define a front panel mock-up using these widgets. 

Graphical engine manages fonts and images. The fonts and images have to be pre-processed before compiling the MicroEJ application. the following diagram depicts the components involved in its design, along with the provided tools:
