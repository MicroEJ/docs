.. _sdk_6_getting_started_imxrt1170:

i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit
==========================

During this Getting Started, you will learn to:

* run an Application on the i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit Virtual Device,
* run the same Application on your i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit.

In case you are not familiar with MicroEJ, please visit `Discover MicroEJ <https://developer.microej.com/discover-microej/>`__ to understand the principles of our technology.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note::
  
   This Getting Started has been tested on Windows 10 & 11. Also note that examples used in this Getting Started could depend on older tools and libraries. Most notably our dependency manager plugin (using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`_) could be an older version.

This Getting Started is separated in two main parts.

The first part consists of running a demo application on the Virtual Device. All you need is:


* An Internet connection to access Github repositories & :ref:`Module Repositories <module_repositories>`.
* MICROEJ SDK 6 (installed during :ref:`Environment Setup <sdk_6_getting_started_imxrt1170_environment_setup>`).

The second part consists of running the same demo application on your device. For that you will need:

* i.MX RT1170 EVKB Evaluation Kit, available `here <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i-mx-rt1170-evaluation-kit:MIMXRT1170-EVKB>`__.
* RK055HDMIPI4MA0 display panel, available `here <https://www.nxp.com/part/RK055HDMIPI4MA0>`__.
* A GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain, Cmake and Make are needed to build the BSP. You will be guided on how to install the toolchain later.
* LinkServer tool to flash the board. You will be guided on how to install this tool later.
* The ::guilabel:`west` command line tool from the Zephyr project. You will be guided on how to install this tool later.

The USB connection is used as a serial console for the SoC, as a CMSIS-DAP debugger and as a power input for the board.

The VEE Port uses the virtual UART from the i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit USB port. A COM port is automatically mounted when the board is plugged into a computer using a USB cable. All board logs are available through this COM port.

The COM port uses the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 10 10 10

   * - Baudrate
     - Data bits
     - Parity bits
     - Stop bits
     - Flow control
   * - 115200
     - 8
     - None
     - 1
     - None

You can have a look at your application logs with an RS232 Terminal (e.g. `Termite <https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm>`__).

Congratulations! You have finished the setup of your environment. You are now ready to discover how to build and flash a MicroEJ application.

Build the Executable for i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to build the Executable of the :guilabel:`animatedMascot` Application, the SDK provides the :guilabel:`buildExecutable` Gradle task.

.. note::
  
   If you are using another IDE than IntelliJ IDEA, please have a look at :ref:`sdk_6_build_executable` section.
   Come back on this page if you need to activate an Evaluation License.

* Double-click on the :guilabel:`buildExecutable` task in the Gradle tasks view.
* The build stops with a failure.
* Go to the top project in the console view and scroll up to get the following error message:

      .. figure:: images/iMXRT1170/getting-started-console-output-license-uid.png
         :alt: Console Output License UID
         :align: center
         :scale: 70%

* Copy the UID. It will be required to activate your Evaluation license.

Request your Evaluation License:

* Request your Evaluation license by following the :ref:`evaluation_license_request_activation_key` instructions. You will be asked to fill the machine UID field with the UID you copied before.

* When you have received your activation key by email, drop it in the license directory by following the :ref:`evaluation_license_install_license_key` instructions (drop the license key zip file to the ``~/.microej/licenses/`` directory).

Now your Evaluation license is installed, you can relaunch your application build by double-clicking on the :guilabel:`buildExecutable` task in the Gradle tasks view. It may take some time.

The Gradle task deploys the Application in the BSP and then builds the BSP using Make.

The :guilabel:`animatedMascot` application is built and ready to be flashed on i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit once the hardware setup is completed.

Flash the Application on the i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to flash the :guilabel:`animatedMascot` Application on i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit, the application provides the Gradle :guilabel:`runOnDevice` task.

.. note::
  
   If you are using another IDE than IntelliJ IDEA, please have a look at :ref:`sdk_6_run_on_device` section.

* Double-click on the :guilabel:`runOnDevice` task in the Gradle tasks view. It may take some time.

      .. figure:: images/iMXRT1170/getting-started-runOnDevice.png

Modify the Java Application
---------------------------

With MicroEJ, it is easy to modify and test your Java application on the Virtual Device.

For example, we could modify the color of the background that is shown on the inside part of the Home Screen.

* Open :guilabel:`ThermoColors.java` file located in the :guilabel:`src/main/java/com/microej/demo/smart_thermostat/style` folder.
* Background color is set line 31, replace the following line:

.. code:: 

   public static final int BG_INSIDE = 0xB6B1AB;

by

.. code:: 

   public static final int BG_INSIDE = Colors.RED;

* Follow :ref:`sdk_6_getting_started_rt1170_run_virtual_device` instructions to launch the modified application on the Virtual Device.

Here is the modified application running in simulation:
