Welcome to the MicroEJ developer documentation.

MicroEJ (pronounced “micro-EDGE”) turns any electronic product or ‘things’ into smart things, MicroEJ tools and libraries enable you to easily create efficient and feature complete applications for embedded devices.
MicroEJ leverages a runtime environment called VEE (`Virtual Execution Environment <overview/vee.html>`_) to simplify and secure embedded development.
