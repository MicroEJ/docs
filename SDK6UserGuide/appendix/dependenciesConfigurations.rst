Dependencies Configurations
===========================

This chapter describes all the dependency configurations added to your project by the MicroEJ Gradle plugins.

.. note::

   The MicroEJ Gradle plugins extend the Gradle Java and Java Library plugins.
   For more information about the configurations inherited from those plugins, 
   refer to the official documentation :
   
      - `Java plugin <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management>`__
      - `Java Library plugin <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_separation>`__

The following graph describes the dependency configurations. Use this legend to interpret the colors:

    - Green background : Dependencies can be declared against this configuration
    - Gray background : This configuration is for consumption by tasks only
    - Blue background : A task

.. graphviz:: graphConfigurations.dot

The MicroEJ Gradle plugins also define dependency configurations for internal use:

    - ``antScriptLauncherClasspath``, used by the :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.tasks.buildVirtualDevice` task
    - ``addonProcessorClasspath`` , used by the :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.tasks.adp` task
    - ``jdtCompilerClasspath``, used by the :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.addon_lib` and :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.application` plugins
    - ``wrapperClasspath``, used by the ``compileJava`` task
    - ``microejRuntimeEnvironmentFullRuntimeClasspath``, used by the :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.tasks.buildVirtualDevice`, :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.tasks.buildApplicationObjectFile` and :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.tasks.buildExecutable` tasks
    - ``microejVeeFullClasspath``, used by the :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.tasks.loadVee` task

Publication Variants
--------------------

The :ref:`sdk6_module_natures.application` plugin defines a list of variants 
that are used during the publication of an Application.

microejWPK
~~~~~~~~~~

This variant is used to publish the WPK of an Application, 
that can be fetched by declaring a dependency with the ``microejApplication`` configuration.
The ``LibraryElement`` attribute of the variant is set to ``microej-wpk``.

microejExecutable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variant is used to publish the Executable of an Application, 
that can be fetched by declaring a dependency with the ``microejVee`` configuration.
The ``LibraryElement`` attribute of the variant is set to ``microej-executable``.

microejExecutableBuildFiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variant is used to publish the files generated when building the Executable of an Application.
The ``LibraryElement`` attribute of the variant is set to ``microej-build-files``.

microejVirtualDevice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variant is used to publish the Virtual Device of an Application, 
that can be fetched by declaring a dependency with the ``microejVee`` configuration.
The ``LibraryElement`` attribute of the variant is set to ``microej-vee-port``.

microejMockRip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variant is used to publish a Mock.
The ``LibraryElement`` attribute of the variant is set to ``microej-rip``.

runtimeEnvironment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This variant is used to publish a Runtime Environment, 
that can be fetched by declaring a dependency with the ``microejRuntimeEnvironment`` configuration.
The ``LibraryElement`` attribute of the variant is set to ``microej-runtime-environment``.

Dependencies Configurations in a VEE Port Project
--------------------------------------------------

This section describes all the dependency configurations added to your VEE Port project by the MicroEJ Gradle plugins.

The following graph describes the dependency configurations. Use this legend to interpret the colors:

    - Green background : Dependencies can be declared against this configuration
    - Gray background : This configuration is for consumption by tasks only
    - Blue background : A task

.. graphviz:: graphVeePortConfigurations.dot

The VEE Port plugin also defines the variant ``microejVeePort`` that is used to :ref:`publish the VEE Port configuration <sdk_6_veeport_publication>`.
