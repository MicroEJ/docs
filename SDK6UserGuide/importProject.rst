Import a Project
================

This chapter explains how to import a project in an IDE.

.. _sdk_6_import_project_eclipse:

Eclipse
-------

.. warning::
   Only the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is fully supported for the moment, so it is recommend to use it instead of Eclipse.
   The support of Eclipse will come soon. 

In order to import an existing Gradle project in Eclipse, follow these steps:

- click on ``File`` > ``Import...``.
- select the project type ``Gradle > Existing Gradle Project`` and click on the ``Next`` button.

- click on the ``Next`` button and finally on the ``Finish`` button.

The Gradle project should now be imported in Eclipse.

.. _sdk_6_import_project_intellij:

IntelliJ IDEA
-------------

In order to import an existing Gradle project in IntelliJ IDEA, follow the following steps:

- click on ``File`` > ``New`` > ``Project From Existing Sources...``.
- select the root directory of the project and click on the ``OK`` button.
- select ``Import project from external model`` and choose ``Gradle``.

   Project Import in IntelliJ IDEA

- click on the ``Create`` button.

The Gradle project should now be imported in IntelliJ IDEA.

.. note::
   A message ``Project JDK is not defined`` is displayed at the top of the editor.
   This message can be ignored.
   It warns that the project does not have a JDK defined, which is expected since a MicroEJ project does not rely on a standard JDK.
