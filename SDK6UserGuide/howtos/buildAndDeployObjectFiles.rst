How To Build and Deploy Object Files without Building the Executable
====================================================================

If you need to produce the object files of the Application, deploy them to the BSP, 
but delegate the build of the Executable to another build system, 
call the ``buildExecutable`` task with the :ref:`Application option <application_options>` ``deploy.bsp.microejscript`` set to ``false``::

    ./gradlew buildExecutable -Dmicroej.option.deploy.bsp.microejscript=false

You should see logs similar to the following ones::

    =============== [ Deployment ] ===============
    The application output file has been generated here: 'C:\Users\johndoe\my-project\my-app\build\application\object\SOAR.o'
    =============== [ Completed Successfully ] ===============
    VEE Port connected to BSP location 'C:\Users\johndoe\my-project\bsp' using platform option 'root.dir' in 'bsp/bsp.properties'.
    =============== [ Deployment ] ===============
    MicroEJ application (microejapp.o) has been deployed to: 'C:\Users\johndoe\my-project\bsp\vee\lib'.
    MicroEJ library (microejruntime.a) has been deployed to: 'C:\Users\johndoe\my-project\bsp\vee\lib'.
