Add a Dependency
================

A project generally relies on other components such as libraries.
These components have to be declared as dependencies of the build to be used by the project.
This declaration is done in the ``dependencies`` block of the ``build.gradle.kts`` file.
For example, to add the EDC library as a dependency::

   dependencies {
      implementation("ej.api:edc:1.3.5")
   }

Configurations
--------------

Every dependency declared for a Gradle project applies to a specific scope.
For example some dependencies should be used for compiling source code whereas others only need to be available at runtime. 
Gradle represents the scope of a dependency with the help of a configuration. 
In the above example, the ``implementation`` configuration is used.

Since the MicroEJ Gradle plugins extend the Gradle Java and Java Library plugins, they inherits from their configurations,
but they also adds their own configurations.
Let's have a look at the mostly used configurations:

- **implementation** (from Gradle Java plugin) : Dependencies used by the project at compile time and runtime.
- **api**  (from Gradle Java Library plugin) : Same as the **implementation** configuration, except that the dependency is also exposed to the consumers of your project.
- **testImplementation** (from Gradle Java plugin) : Dependencies used by the test classes of the project.
  This configuration extends the **implementation** configuration, so it inherits from all the dependencies declared with the **implementation** configuration.
- **microejVeePort** : VEE Port used by the project for build and test.

Here is an example of dependencies declaration for a project::

   dependencies {
      implementation("ej.library.runtime:basictool:1.7.0")

      testImplementation("ej.library.test:junit:1.7.1")

      microejVeePort("com.microej.platform.esp32.esp-wrover-kit-v41:HDAHT:1.8.0")
   }

In this example, the ``ej.library.runtime:basictool`` module is used at compile time and runtime, 
the ``ej.library.test:junit`` module is used for the tests compilation and execution, 
and the ``com.microej.platform.esp32.esp-wrover-kit-v41:HDAHT`` module is the VEE Port used for build and test.

For an exhaustive list of the available configurations and more details on how to manage dependencies, 
refer to the following official documentations:

- `Declaring dependencies <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html>`__
- `Java plugin <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management>`__
- `Java Library plugin <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_separation>`__

Version
-------

The version declared in the dependencies of a build file are explicit:

- Release version: to depend on a released version of a module, the exact fixed version must be used (e.g., ``1.0.0``).
- Snapshot version: to depend on a snapshot version (``-RC``) of a module, the version must be declared explicitly with the ``-RC+`` suffix (e.g., ``1.0.0-RC+``).

.. note::
   This is an important change compared to the SDK 5.
   In the SDK 5, using a fixed version (e.g., ``1.0.0``) fetched the release version (e.g., ``1.0.0``) if it existed, 
   or a snapshot version (e.g., ``1.0.0-RCxxx``) otherwise. 
   This is not the case anymore in the SDK 6.

Dependencies Repositories
-------------------------

Gradle needs to know in which repositories the modules must be fetched and published.
The :ref:`SDK 6 installation process <sdk_6_install>` provides a Gradle Init Script to declare all the MicroEJ public repositories.
Of course you can declare other repositories, either in the same Gradle Init Script and in any other location supported by Gradle.
Refer to `the official documentation <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html>`__ for 
more information on repositories configuration.

It is important to note that the declaration order of the repositories matters.
Gradle requests the repositories in the order they are declared and stops as soon as it finds a matching version.
