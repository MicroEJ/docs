Test a VEE Port
===============

The SDK provides the capability to test a VEE Port.
While you can create your own tests, 
MicroEJ provides a set of tools and pre-defined projects aimed at simplifying the steps for validating VEE Ports 
in the form of the ``VEE Port Qualification Tools (PQT)``.

Please refer to the `VEE Port Project Template README <https://github.com/MicroEJ/Tool-Project-Template-VEEPort/tree/master/vee-port/validation>`__ 
to learn how to setup and run this Qualification process.

Configure a Testsuite
=====================

The SDK allows to configure the Testsuite, as well as the Tests being executed.
Refer to the :ref:`sdk_6_testsuite_engine_options` section to discover the configuration options.

Besides allowing to configure the Testsuite in the ``build.gradle.kts`` file of the Testsuite,
the configuration properties can be defined in the ``config.properties`` file located at the root of the Testsuite project.
For example::

   # The testsuite timeout (in seconds)
   microej.testsuite.timeout=600

   # The number of times we'll retry a test if it fails
   microej.testsuite.retry.count=1

Also, the configuration options used for each test can be defined in the ``validation/microej-testsuite-common.properties`` 
file located at the root of the Testsuite project.
For example::

   # Java memory settings
   core.memory.immortal.memory=RAM
   core.memory.immortal.size=64000
