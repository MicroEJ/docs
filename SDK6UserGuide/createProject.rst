.. _sdk_6_create_project:

Create a Project
================

This chapter explains the different ways to create a new Application, Library or Mock project.
If you want to create a VEE Port project, refer to the :ref:`sdk_6_veeport_create` section.

.. note::
  The different project creation systems do not produce exactly the same project content and structure.
  Especially, the IntelliJ IDEA wizard produces a simple project whereas the Android Studio, Command Line Interface and Eclipse wizards create multi-projects builds.
  Both structures (single and multi projects) can be used, the recommended one depends on the context (components, size of the project, ...).
  Refer to `the official Gradle documentation <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html>`__ for more information.

   .. tab:: IntelliJ IDEA

      The creation of a project with IntelliJ IDEA is done as follows:
      
      - Click on :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`New` > :guilabel:`Project...`.
      - Select :guilabel:`MicroEJ` in :guilabel:`Generators` list on the left panel.
      - Fill the name of the project in the :guilabel:`Name` field.
      - Select the location of the project in the :guilabel:`Location` field.
      - Select the project type. If there is no button for your project type, click on :guilabel:`Other` button and select it in the drop-down list.
      - If you selected :guilabel:`Application` project type, you can check :guilabel:`This is a kernel application` checkbox if your Application is a Kernel.
      - Fill the version of the artifact to publish in the :guilabel:`Version` field.
      - Fill the group of the artifact to publish in the :guilabel:`Group` field.
      - Fill the name of the artifact to publish in the :guilabel:`Artifact` field.
      - Select the JVM used by Gradle in the :guilabel:`JDK` combobox.
      - Check the :guilabel:`Add sample code` checkbox.
      - Click on :guilabel:`Create` button.

         Project Creation in IntelliJ IDEA

      .. note::
         The Gradle project created by the wizard uses Gradle Wrapper with Gradle version ``8.10.2``.
         Refer to the :ref:`sdk_6_create_project_gradle_wrapper` section for more information.

      .. note::
         By default, IntelliJ IDEA automatically saves any file change, 
         but requires the user to explicitly trigger the reload of a Gradle project when its configuration has changed.
         Therefore, when the configuration of a Gradle project has been updated, 
         you have to click on the reload icon button which appears on the right of the editor:

         You can also configure IntelliJ IDEA to automatically reload a Gradle project after a change.
         Refer to the :ref:`sdk_6_howto_gradle_autoreloading` section for more information.
      
      .. warning::
       When reloading your Gradle project, the build can fail if the SDK EULA has not been accepted.
       In that case, you must set the ``ACCEPT_MICROEJ_SDK_EULA_V3_1C`` environment variable to ``YES`` and
       restart IntelliJ IDEA. For more information about SDK EULA, refer to the :ref:`sdk_6_licenses` chapter.

      When the Gradle project is loaded, it should compile successfully, without any error.
      You can then learn :ref:`how to launch the build of the project <sdk_6_build_project>`, 
      or :ref:`how to run it on the Simulator <sdk_6_run_on_simulator>` in the case of an Application.

   .. tab:: Android Studio

      The creation of a project with Android Studio is done as follows:
      
      - Click on :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`New` > :guilabel:`Project...`.
      - Select :guilabel:`Generic` > :guilabel:`New MicroEJ project`.

      - Select the location of the project in the :guilabel:`Save location` field.
      - Keep the default Android SDK in the :guilabel:`Minimum SDK` field.
      - Select :guilabel:`Kotlin` for the :guilabel:`Build configuration language` field.
      
      .. note::
        Groovy build script DSL is not officially supported by the SDK, so the project created by the Wizard uses Kotlin regardless
        of the language selected by the user.

         Refer to the :ref:`sdk_6_create_project_gradle_wrapper` section for more information.

      The project created by the wizard is a multi-project with a single subproject (named ``app``).
      The type of this subproject is the type that has previously been chosen.

Configure a Project
-------------------

The SDK allows to build several types of modules.
Each type has its own Gradle plugin and configuration options.
Refer to the module type you want to build to configure your project:

- :ref:`Application <sdk_6_create_project_configure_application>`
- :ref:`Add-On Library <sdk_6_create_project_configure_addon_library>`
- :ref:`Mock <sdk_6_create_project_configure_mock>`

    plugins {
        id("com.microej.gradle.application") version "1.0.0"
    }

  .. note::
    The ``java`` plugin must not be added since it is automatically applied by the MicroEJ plugin.

- Create the Java main class in the ``src/main/java`` folder.
- Define the property ``applicationEntryPoint`` in the ``microej`` configuration block of the ``build.gradle.kts`` file.
  It must be set to the Full Qualified Name of the Application main class, for example::

   microej {

   you must :ref:`configure the repositories <sdk_6_configure_repositories>` before creating the module.
   If the repositories used by your project are `centralized <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories_adv.html#sub:centralized-repository-declaration>`__ 
   in the :guilabel:`settings.gradle.kts` file of the project, the MicroEJ repositories defined in

      - Follow the same steps to create the ``src/main/resources``, ``src/test/java`` and ``src/test/resources`` folders.

   .. tab:: Visual Studio Code

      The creation of a module with Visual Studio Code is done as follows:
      
      - If the :guilabel:`Explorer` view is not already opened, open it by selecting :guilabel:`View` > :guilabel:`Open View...` > :guilabel:`Explorer`.
      - Right-click in the :guilabel:`Explorer` view and click on :guilabel:`New Folder...`.
      - Fill the name of the module and press :guilabel:`Enter`.
      - Create a new ``build.gradle.kts`` file by right-clicking on your newly created folder and clicking on :guilabel:`New File...`.
      - :ref:`Configure your module <sdk_6_create_project_configure_project>` depending on its type.
      - Declare the dependencies required by your module in the ``dependencies`` block. For example::
      
          dependencies {
              implementation("ej.api:edc:1.3.7")
          }
            
      - Open the ``settings.gradle.kts`` file of your project and add the following content::
      
          include("<module_name>")
      
      - Create the ``src/main/java`` folder by right-clicking on the newly created module and clicking on :guilabel:`New Folder...`.
      - Follow the same steps to create the ``src/main/resources``, ``src/test/java`` and ``src/test/resources`` folders.

.. _sdk_6_create_project_gradle_wrapper:

Gradle Wrapper
--------------

It is recommended to use the Gradle Wrapper to execute a build.
The Wrapper is a script that ensures that the required version of Gradle is downloaded and used during the build of a project.

When creating a project following one of the project creation systems described in the :ref:`sdk_6_create_project` section, 
the Wrapper files are automatically generated in the ``gradle/wrapper`` folder of the project.
It is also possible to add the Wrapper to an existing project. 
This requires to `install the Gradle distribution <https://gradle.org/install/>`__, then to execute the ``wrapper`` task with::

  gradle wrapper

The Gradle version used by the project can then be updated in the ``gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`` file. 
The SDK requires Gradle ``8.6`` or higher::

  distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.6-bin.zip

To use the Wrapper during a build, use ``gradlew`` or ``./gradlew`` depending on your OS instead of ``gradle`` in the command line:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Windows

      gradlew build

   .. tab:: Linux

      ./gradlew build

In the following chapters of the documentation, the Linux command ``./gradlew`` is used in all examples to execute a build.

Refer to `the official Gradle documentation <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html>`__ for more information about the Wrapper.
