Now you know how to run an application on a Virtual Device.

If you want to learn how to run an application on your i.MX93 Evaluation Kit, you can continue this Getting Started: :ref:`Run an Application on i.MX93 Evaluation Kit <sdk_6_getting_started_imx93_run_on_device>`.

Otherwise, learn how to :ref:`Modify the Java Application <sdk_6_getting_started_imx93_modify_java_application>`.

.. _sdk_6_getting_started_imx93_run_on_device:

Run an Application on i.MX93 Evaluation Kit
-------------------------------------------

To deploy :guilabel:`Example-Java-Widget` application on your board, you will have to:

* Setup your environment (toolchain, hardware setup).
* Request a 30 days :ref:`Evaluation License <sdk_eula>` and install an activation key.
* Build the executable.
* Run the executable on board.

Environment Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This chapter takes approximately one hour and will take you through the steps to build a VEE executable and set up the evaluation kit.

Install the Yocto SDK
"""""""""""""""""""""

The executable is built using a Yocto SDK, it contains the following:

* The C toolchain.
* The cross compiled librairies.
* All the necessary headers (libc, but also the headers of the kernel and the librairies installed in the firmware rootfs).
* An environment setup script (to set $CC, $LD, $SDKSYSROOT variables).

A prebuilt version of the Yocto SDK is available here: (TBD)

To install the Yocto SDK use the following commands in WSL or Linux:

.. code-block::

   $ chmod +x oecore-x86_64-armv7at2hf-neon-vfpv4-toolchain-nodistro.0.sh
   $ ./oecore-x86_64-armv7at2hf-neon-vfpv4-toolchain-nodistro.0.sh
   MicroEJ: 32-bit userspace + 64-bit kernel SDK installer version nodistro.0
   ==========================================================================
   Enter target directory for SDK (default: /usr/local/oecore-x86_64): 
   You are about to install the SDK to "/usr/local/oecore-x86_64". Proceed [Y/n]? Y
   [sudo] password for xxxxx:
   Extracting SDK.................................................................................done
   Setting it up...done
   SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.
   Each time you wish to use the SDK in a new shell session, you need to source the environment setup script e.g.
   $ . /usr/local/oecore-x86_64/environment-setup-armv7at2hf-neon-vfpv4-oemllib32-linux-gnueabi
   $ . /usr/local/oecore-x86_64/environment-setup-cortexa55-oe-linux

The installation path can be then used to build the VEE executable.

Flash the image on a SD card
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Linux image is available here: (TBD)

For this getting started we use a Linux image flashed on a SD card.

Linux
+++++

To flash the image on Linux use the following command:

.. code-block::

   bmaptool copy lib32-core-image-microej-microej-imx93.wic.gz /dev/mmcblk0

Windows
+++++++

To flash the image on Windows do the following:

* Install Rufus: https://rufus.ie/en/.
* Extract the ``.wic`` file from the archive ``lib32-core-image-microej-microej-imx93.wic.gz``.
* Flash the ``.wic`` on the SD card with Rufus.

Running the IMX93 VEE Port
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default the i.MX93 evaluation kit will boot from the eMMC.
To change the boot mode to micro SD, set the DIP switch ``BMODE`` to ``0010``.

Insert the flashed SD card and boot the device. After a few seconds the display will show the IMX93 Getting Started Welcome page.
If no display is attached, information such as device IP address and documentation link will also be printed in the logs.

Congratulations, you have finished the setup of your environment. You are now ready to discover how to build and run a MicroEJ application.

Build the Executable for i.MX93 Evaluation Kit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to build the Executable of the :guilabel:`Example-Java-Widget` Application, the SDK provides the Gradle :guilabel:`buildExecutable` task.

.. note::
  
   If you are using another IDE than IntelliJ IDEA, please have a look at :ref:`sdk_6_build_executable` section.
   Come back on this page if you need to activate an Evaluation License.

* Double-click on the :guilabel:`buildExecutable` task in the Gradle tasks view.
* The build stops with a failure.
* Go to the top project in the console view and scroll up to get the following error message:

      .. figure:: images/gettingStarted/iMXRT1170/getting-started-console-output-license-uid.png
         :alt: Console Output License UID
         :align: center
         :scale: 70%

* Copy the UID. It will be required to activate your Evaluation license.

Request your Evaluation License:

* Request your Evaluation license by following the :ref:`evaluation_license_request_activation_key` instructions. You will be asked to fill the machine UID you just copied before.

* When you have received your activation key by email, drop it in the license directory by following the :ref:`evaluation_license_install_license_key` instructions (drop the license key zip file to the ``~/.microej/licenses/`` directory).

Now your Evaluation license is installed, you can relaunch your application build by double-clicking on the :guilabel:`buildExecutable` task in the Gradle tasks view. It may takes some time.

The gradle task deploys the Application in the BSP and then builds the BSP using Make.

The :guilabel:`Example-Java-Widget` application is built and ready to be flashed on i.MX93 Evaluation Kit once the hardware setup is completed.

Run the Application on the i.MX93 Evaluation Kit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to run the :guilabel:`Example-Java-Widget` Application on i.MX93 Evaluation Kit, the application provides the Gradle :guilabel:`runOnDevice` task.

.. note::
  
   If you are using another IDE than IntelliJ IDEA, please have a look at :ref:`sdk_6_run_on_device` section.

* Double-click on the :guilabel:`runOnDevice` task in the Gradle tasks view. It may takes some time.

      .. figure:: images/gettingStarted/iMXRT1170/getting-started-runOnDevice.png
         :alt: runOnDevice task
         :align: center
         :scale: 70%

Once the application is running, you should see the :guilabel:`Example-Java-Widget` on your board.      

.. _sdk_6_getting_started_imx93_modify_java_application:

Modify the Java Application
---------------------------

With MicroEJ, it is easy to modify and test your Java application on the Virtual Device.

For example, we could modify the color of the background (TBD).
