i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit
=========================

During this Getting Started, you will learn to run:

* run an Application on the i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit Virtual Device,
* run the same Application on your i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit.

In case you are not familiar with MicroEJ, please visit `Discover MicroEJ <https://developer.microej.com/discover-microej/>`__ to understand the principles of our technology.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. note::
  
   This Getting Started has been tested on Windows 10 & 11.

This Getting Started is separated in two main parts.

The first part consists of running a demo application on the Virtual Device. All you need is:

* An Internet connection to access Github repositories & :ref:`Module Repositories <module_repositories>`.
* MICROEJ SDK 6 (installed during :ref:`Environment Setup <sdk_6_getting_started_imxrt595_environment_setup>`).

The second part consists of running the same demo application on your device. For that you will need:

* i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit, available `here <https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i-mx-rt595-evaluation-kit:MIMXRT595-EVK>`__.
* G1120B0MIPI display panel, available `here <https://www.nxp.com/part/G1120B0MIPI>`__,
* A GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain, Cmake and Make are needed to build the BSP. You will be guided on how to install toolchain later.
* LinkServer tool to flash the board. You will be guided on how to install this tool later.

.. _sdk_6_getting_started_rt595_run_on_device:

Run an Application on i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit
-----------------------------------------------

To deploy :guilabel:`Demo-Wearable-VG` application on your board, you will have to:

* Setup your Environment (Toolchain, flashing-tool, hardware setup).
* Request a 30 days :ref:`Evaluation License <sdk_eula>` and install an activation key.
* Build the Executable.
* Flash the board.

Environment Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This chapter takes approximately one hour and will take you through the steps to set up your board and build the BSP.

Install the C Toolchain
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The C toolchain must be installed, it is composed of the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain, CMake and Make.

.. note::
  
   This Getting Started has been tested with the following configuration:

   - GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain version ``10.3 2021.10``.
   - CMake version ``3.26.5``.
   - Make version ``3.81``.

   Later versions may or may not work, and may need modification to the Getting Started steps.

Install GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The toolchain is the `GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain <https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm>`__. 

At the end of the installation, it will ask you to complete the Setup of the wizard, choose the following options: 

      .. figure:: images/gettingStarted/iMXRT595/getting-started-arm-gcc-installation.png
         :alt: Import demo application
         :align: center
         :scale: 70%

Once installed, ``ARMGCC_DIR`` must be set as an environment variable and point to the toolchain directory. To do so: 

* Open the :guilabel:`Edit the system environment variables` application on Windows.
* Click on the :guilabel:`Environment Variables...` button.
* Click on the :guilabel:`New...` button under the :guilabel:`User variables` section.
* Set :guilabel:`Variable Name` to ``ARMGCC_DIR``.
* Set :guilabel:`Variable Value` to the toolchain directory (e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\10 2021.10``).
* Click on the :guilabel:`Ok` button until it closes :guilabel:`Edit the system environment variables` application.

Install CMake
+++++++++++++

`CMake <https://cmake.org/download/>`__ is the application used by the build system to generate the firmware.

During the installation, it will ask you if you wish to add CMake to your system Path, add it at least to the current user system path.
If you missed it, you can manually add ``CMake/bin`` folder to your path.

Install Make
++++++++++++

`Make <https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm>`__ is the tool that will generate the executable based on the files generated by CMake. It will also be used to flash the board. 
Under :guilabel:`Download` section, you can select the Setup program for the complete package, except sources. 

By default, it will automatically add Make to your path.
If not, you can manually add ``GnuWin32\bin`` folder to your path.

Install the Flashing Tool
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
  
   This Getting Started has been tested with LinkServer version ``1.2.45``. 

   Later versions may or may not work, and may need modification to the Getting Started steps.

`LinkServer <https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/linkserver-for-microcontrollers:LINKERSERVER>`__ is needed to flash the board.

Once installed, ``LinkServer_xxx/binaries`` folder must be set on your Path. To do so: 

* Open the :guilabel:`Edit the system environment variables` application on Windows.
* Click on the :guilabel:`Environment Variables...` button.
* Select :guilabel:`Path` variable under the :guilabel:`User variables` section and edit it.
* Click on :guilabel:`New` and point to the ``binaries`` folder located where you installed LinkServer (e.g. ``nxp/LinkServer_1.2.45/binaries``).

Hardware Setup
""""""""""""""

      .. figure:: images/gettingStarted/iMXRT595/getting-started-hardware-setup.png
         :alt: Hardware Setup
         :align: center
         :scale: 70%

Setup the i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit:

* Check that the dip switches (SW7) are set to OFF, OFF and ON (ISP0, ISP1, ISP2).
* Ensure jumpers JP18 and JP19 are closed.
* Remove jumper JP4.
* Connect the micro-USB cable to J40 to power the board.

The USB connection is used as a serial console for the SoC, as a CMSIS-DAP debugger, and as a power input for the board.

A COM port is automatically mounted when the board is plugged into a computer using a USB cable. All board logs are available through this COM port.

The COM port uses the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 10 10 10

   * - Baudrate
     - Data bits
     - Parity bits
     - Stop bits
     - Flow control
   * - 115200
     - 8
     - None
     - 1
     - None

You can have a look at your application logs with an RS232 Terminal (e.g. `Termite <https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm>`__).

Congratulations, you have finished the setup of your environment. You are now ready to discover how to build and flash a MicroEJ application.

Build the Executable for i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to build the Executable of the :guilabel:`Demo-Wearable-VG` Application, the SDK provides the Gradle :guilabel:`buildExecutable` task.

.. note::
  
   If you are using another IDE than IntelliJ IDEA, please have a look at :ref:`sdk_6_build_executable` section.
   Come back on this page if you need to activate an Evaluation License.

* Double-click on the :guilabel:`buildExecutable` task in the Gradle tasks view.
* The build stops with a failure.
* Go to the top project in the console view and scroll up to get the following error message:

      .. figure:: images/gettingStarted/iMXRT595/getting-started-console-output-license-uid.png
         :alt: Console Output License UID
         :align: center
         :scale: 70%

* Copy the UID. It will be required to activate your Evaluation license.

Request your Evaluation License:

* Request your Evaluation license by following the :ref:`evaluation_license_request_activation_key` instructions. You will be asked to fill the machine UID you just copied before.

* When you have received your activation key by email, drop it in the license directory by following the :ref:`evaluation_license_install_license_key` instructions (drop the license key zip file to the ``~/.microej/licenses/`` directory).

Now your Evaluation license is installed, you can relaunch your application build by double-clicking on the :guilabel:`buildExecutable` task in the Gradle tasks view. It may takes some time.

The gradle task deploys the MicroEJ application in the BSP and then builds the BSP using Make.

The :guilabel:`Demo-Wearable-VG` application is built and ready to be flashed on i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit once the hardware setup is completed.

Flash the Application on the i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to flash the :guilabel:`Demo-Wearable-VG` Application on i.MX RT595 Evaluation Kit, the application provides the Gradle :guilabel:`runOnDevice` task.

.. note::
  
   If you are using another IDE than IntelliJ IDEA, please have a look at :ref:`sdk_6_run_on_device` section.

* Double-click on the :guilabel:`runOnDevice` task in the Gradle tasks view. It may takes some time.

      .. figure:: images/gettingStarted/iMXRT595/getting-started-runOnDevice.png
         :alt: runOnDevice task
         :align: center
         :scale: 70%

Once the firmware is flashed, you should see the :guilabel:`Demo-Wearable-VG` running on your board.

.. _sdk_6_getting_started_rt595_modify_java_application:

Modify the Java Application
---------------------------

With MicroEJ, it is easy to modify and test your Java application on the Virtual Device.

For example, we could modify the color of the date on the Flower Watchface that is shown at the startup of the application.

* Open :guilabel:`FlowerWatchface.java` file located in the :guilabel:`watchface-flower/src/main/java/com/microej/demo/watch/watchface/flower` folder.
* On the :guilabel:`renderDate` method, replace the following line:

.. code:: 

   g.setColor(style.getColor());

by

.. code:: 

   g.setColor(Colors.GREEN);

* Follow :ref:`sdk_6_getting_started_rt595_run_virtual_device` instructions to launch the modified application on the Virtual Device.

Here is the modified application running in simulation:
