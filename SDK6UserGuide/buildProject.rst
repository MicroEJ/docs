Build a Project
===============

Generally speaking, building a project means compiling the source files, executing the tests and generating the module artifact.
Depending on the nature of the project, the build can include other specific phases.
Refer to the :ref:`sdk6_module_natures` page for a complete description of the build phases.

The build of a project is done by executing the Gradle ``build`` task.
It can be executed with the command line interface::

    $ gradle build

or from Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, by double-clicking on the ``build`` task in the Gradle tasks view:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Eclipse

      .. image:: images/eclipse-build-gradle-project.png
         :width: 50%
         :align: center

   .. tab:: IntelliJ IDEA

      .. image:: images/intellij-build-gradle-project.png
         :width: 30%
         :align: center

Gradle stores the artifacts produced by the build in the ``build/libs`` folder.

.. note::

   If the build fails with a message related to the ``Artifact Checker`` such as::

      The Artifact Checker found the following problems:
   
   Fix the listed problems or skip the Artifact Checker by adding the following line in the build script file::

      project.gradle.startParameter.excludedTaskNames.add("checkModule")
