Select a VEE Port
=================

Building or running an Application or a Test Suite with the SDK requires a VEE Port.

There are 3 different ways to provide a VEE Port for a module project:

- Set the build property ``veePortFile`` to the path of a VEE Port file (``.zip``, ``.jpf`` or ``.vde``).
- Set the build property ``veePortDir`` to the path of the ``source`` folder of an already imported :ref:`Source VEE Port <source_platform_import>`.
- Declare a module dependency with the conf ``microejVeePort``:

   .. code:: java

      dependencies {
         microejVeePort("com.mycompany:myveeport:1.0.0")
      }

   .. note::

      For dependencies stored in an Ivy repository, Gradle fetches them with the configuration ``default``.
      If several artifacts are published with this configuration, the build will fail because it doesn't know which artifact to choose.
      You can select the right artifact by adding information on the one to fetch in the ``artifact`` block, for example::

         microejVeePort("com.mycompany:myveeport:1.0.0") {
            artifact {
               name = "artifact-name"
               type = "zip"
            }
         }

      This will select the artifact with the name ``artifact-name`` and with the type ``zip``.
      
      Please refer to `the Gradle documentation <https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html>`__ 
      to learn all the options to select dependencies.

At least 1 of these 3 ways is required to build an Application with a VEE Port.
If several ways are used, the following rules are applied:

- If ``veePortFile`` or ``veePortDir`` is set, the other options are ignored.
- If the module project defined several VEE Ports, the build fails. For example the following cases are not allowed:

  - Setting a VEE Port with the option ``veePortFile`` and another one with the option ``veePortDir``
  - Declaring 2 VEE Ports as Dependencies
