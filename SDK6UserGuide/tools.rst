Development Tools
#################

MicroEJ provides a number of tools to assist with various aspects of development.
These tools are either command line tools or Eclipse IDE plugins.

**Command line tools**

Command line tools can be executed using the gradle task ``execTool``.

The format of the task is as follow:

::

   ./gradlew execTool --name=TOOL_NAME --toolProperty=PROPERTY="VALUE" --toolProperty=PROPERTY="VALUE" ...

The parameter required ``--name`` is used to describe the name of the tool to execute.
The optional parameters ``--toolProperty`` are used to configure the tool's options.

In addition, the tool's options can be defined in ``configuration/tools/TOOL_NAME.properties``.

The following sections describe the command line tools and their options:

   :maxdepth: 1

   stackTraceReader
   codeCoverageAnalyzer
