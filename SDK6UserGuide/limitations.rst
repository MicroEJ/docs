.. _sdk_6_limitations:

Scope and Limitations
=====================

The SDK 6 allows to:

- Build the Java artifact of an Application and an Add-On Library.
- Execute the tests of a project with the Simulator and on a device.
- Execute the Artifact Checker on a project.
- Run an Application with the Simulator.
- Load the VEE Port from its archive file path, its folder path, a dependency or from the ``dropins`` folder.
- Build the Executable of an Application.
- Build the WPK of an Application.
- Build the Feature file (.fo) of an Application.
- Build the Virtual Device of an Application.

Therefore, it does not support all the features of the SDK 5, especially:

- Build of Foundation Libraries, Mocks, VEE Ports or any other component type except Applications and Add-On Libraries.
- Resolve dependencies in the IDE.
- Launch of MicroEJ tools, such as the Stack Trace Reader.
- Font Designer, Memory Map Analyzer, Heap Analyzer and Front Panel Designer.

If you need these features, you have to use :ref:`the SDK 5 <sdk_user_guide>`.
