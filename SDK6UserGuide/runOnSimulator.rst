Run on Simulator
================

In order to execute an Application on the Simulator, the SDK provides the Gradle ``runOnSimulator`` task.
The prerequisites of this task are:

- the property ``applicationMainClass`` must be defined in the ``microej`` configuration block of the Gradle build file of the project.
  It must be set to the Full Qualified Name of the Application main class, for example::

   microej {
     applicationMainClass = "com.mycompany.Main"
   }

- the target Platform must be defined.
  Refer to the :ref:`sdk_6_platform_selection` page to know the different ways to provide a Platform for a module project.

Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, the Application can be started with the Simulator with the command line interface::

    $ gradle runOnSimulator

or from Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, by double-clicking on the ``runOnSimulator`` task in the Gradle tasks view:

.. |pic1| image:: images/eclipse-run-gradle-project.png
   :width: 48%

.. |pic2| image:: images/intellij-run-gradle-project.png
   :width: 30%

With a simple Hello World Application, the output should be::

   =============== [ Initialization Stage ] ===============
   =============== [ Converting fonts ] ===============
   =============== [ Converting images ] ===============
   =============== [ Launching on Simulator ] ===============
   Hello World!
   =============== [ Completed Successfully ] ===============
   
   SUCCESS


Verbose mode
------------

If you need more information about the execution of the Application with the Simulator, 
the verbose mode can be enabled by using the ``--info`` Gradle option::

   gradle runOnSimulator --info


Debug on Simulator
------------------

The SDK allows to run an Application with the Simulator in debug mode thanks to the Gradle task ``debugOnSimulator``::

   gradle debugOnSimulator

This task activates the debug mode on the port ``12000`` by default. 
The port can be changed by using the System Property ``debug.port``::

   gradle debugOnSimulator -Ddebug.port=8000

Once started, the Simulator waits for the connection of a debugger.

If you want to connect the Eclipse debugger:

- add a breakpoint in your Application code.
- click on ``Run > Debug Configurations...``.
- select ``Remote Java Application``.
- click on the ``New launch configuration`` button.
- give a name to the launcher in the ``Name`` field.
- set the debug host and port.
- click on the ``Debug`` button.

If you want to connect the IntelliJ IDEA debugger:

- add a breakpoint in your Application code.
- click on ``Run > Debug...``.
- click on ``Edit Configurations...``.
- click on the ``+`` button in the top bar and select ``Remote JVM Debug``.
- give a name to the launcher in the ``Name`` field.
- set the debug host and port.
- click on the ``Debug`` button.

The debugger should connect to the Simulator and you should be able to debug your Application.
