Java compiler version issue
---------------------------

The SDK: requires a JDK 11, so when a JDK 8 is used, the following kind of error is raised::

	A problem occurred configuring root project 'myProject'.
	> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':classpath'.
	> Could not resolve com.microej.gradle.plugins:plugins:0.3.0.
		Required by:
			project : > com.microej.gradle.library:com.microej.gradle.library.gradle.plugin:0.3.0:20221118.151454-1
		> No matching variant of com.microej.gradle.plugins:plugins:0.3.0:20221118.151454-1 was found. The consumer was configured to find a runtime of a library compatible with Java 8, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '7.4' but:
			- Variant 'apiElements' capability com.microej.gradle.plugins:plugins:0.3.0 declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
				- Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 8
				- Other compatible attribute:
					- Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.4')
			- Variant 'javadocElements' capability com.microej.gradle.plugins:plugins:0.3.0 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
				- Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library
				- Other compatible attributes:
					- Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)
					- Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)
					- Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.4')
			- Variant 'runtimeElements' capability com.microej.gradle.plugins:plugins:0.3.0 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
				- Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 8
				- Other compatible attribute:
					- Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.4')
			- Variant 'sourcesElements' capability com.microej.gradle.plugins:plugins:0.3.0 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:
				- Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library
				- Other compatible attributes:
					- Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)
					- Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)
					- Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.4')

Use a JDK 11 instead to fix this error.
