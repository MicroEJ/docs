Get Support
===========

If any questions, the best starting point is to consult the `MicroEJ Forum <https://forum.microej.com/>`_. 
Feel free to create a new topic if there is no relevant content for your issue. 
MicroEJ Corp. engineers are listening to the forum activity, so you can expect to get a quick reply.

Otherwise, you can contact `our support team <https://www.microej.com/contact/#form_2>`_.

In both cases, please provide as much information as possible on your installed environment (the table below is an example):
