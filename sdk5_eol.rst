      This documentation is for SDK 5. The latest major version is <a class="reference internal" href="../SDK6UserGuide/index.html"><span class="std std-ref">SDK 6</span></a>.
      SDK 5 is in maintenance mode since the release of <a class="reference internal" href="./sdkChangeLog.html#changelog-5-8-0">SDK 5.8.0</a>.
      Consequently, as stated in the <a class="reference internal" href="./licenses.html#sdk-eula">SDK End User License Agreement (EULA)</a>, the SDK will reach the end of its life by July 2028.
      Contact <a class="reference internal" href="../support.html#get-support">our support team</a> for assistance with migrating to the new SDK, or your sales representative if you require an extension of SDK maintenance as a service.
