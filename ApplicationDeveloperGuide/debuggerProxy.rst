VEE Debugger Proxy
##################

Principle
=========

The VEE debugger proxy is an implementation of the Java Debug Wire protocol (JDWP) for debugging Applications executed by MICROEJ VEE.
It consists of a TCP server implementing the JDWP protocol and acting as a proxy between the IDE (debugger) and the Executable (debuggee) running on the device.

The debugger proxy allows a postmortem debug from a snapshot of the memory (core dump file for Linux/QNX targets and Intel Hex file for MCU targets) of a running Executable binary.

   Debugger Proxy Principle

.. warning::
    
    The snapshot of the memory (core dump or Intel Hex files) should only be generated when the Core Engine task is stopped on one of the Core Engine hooks (``LLMJVM_on_OutOfMemoryError_thrown``, ``LLMJVM_on_Runtime_gc_done`` etc.) or in a native function. 
    Otherwise, the Core Engine memory dump is not guarranted to be consistent, which may cause the VEE Debugger to crash abruptly. 

.. note::
    This feature requires Architecture version ``8.1.0`` or higher and works for both Mono-Sandbox and Multi-Sandbox Executables.

Installation
============

Download the VEE Debugger Proxy tool ``jdwp-server-[version].jar`` at https://forge.microej.com/artifactory/microej-sdk6-repository-release/com/microej/tool/jdwp-server/1.0.1/jdwp-server-1.0.1.jar .

Debugging Executable for Linux or QNX target
============================================

In order to debug an Executable for Linux or QNX target, you need to dump the memory of the running Executable and then run the VEE Debugger Proxy.

For Linux and QNX target, the memory dump must be a core dump file.

Generate a Core Dump File using GDB
-----------------------------------

Open a shell terminal on the device and enter the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    # Instruct the Linux kernel to Dump file-backed private mappings.
    echo 0x37 > /proc/self/coredump_filter
    # Start GDB
    gdb ./application.out

The following GDB script can be used to generate a core dump file:

- when the signal ``SIGUSR1`` is received
- or when an out of memory error occurs 
- or when an explicit garbage collection (GC) is done.

You can run the script directly in the GDB console.

.. code-block:: sh

   ## From GBD documentation:
   ## generate-core-file [file]
   ##   Produce a core dump of the inferior process.
   ##   The optional argument file specifies the file name where to put the core dump.
   ##   If not specified, the file name defaults to 'core.pid', where pid is the inferior process ID.

   ## Generate a core dump when the signal SIGUSR1 is received
   catch signal SIGUSR1
   commands 
   silent
   generate-core-file
   cont
   end

   ## Generate a core dump when an out of memory error occurs
   break LLMJVM_on_OutOfMemoryError_thrown
   commands 
   silent
   generate-core-file
   cont
   end

   ## Generate a core dump when an explicit garbage collection (GC) is done
   break LLMJVM_on_Runtime_gc_done
   commands 
   silent
   generate-core-file
   cont
   end

Starts executing the Mono-Sandbox Executable under GDB:

.. code-block:: sh

    # In the GDB console:
    run


A core dump file will be generated once the Executable reach one of the breaking conditions described previously.

Run the VEE Debugger Proxy
--------------------------

Open a shell terminal on your workstation and run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    java -DveePortDir=<path to VEE Port directory> \
        -Ddebugger.port=<8000> \
        -Ddebugger.out.path=<path to the Executable file (application.out)> \
        -Ddebugger.features.out.path=<comma-separated list of the Feature files with debug information (*.fodbg files). To be used if you want to debug an installed Sandboxed Application> \
        -Ddebugger.out.coredump.path=<path to the core dump file> \
        -jar jdwp-server-[version].jar


Open the SDK and run a :ref:`Remote Java Application Launch <debug_on_device>` to debug your code.

Debugging Executable for MCU target
===================================

The VEE Debugger Proxy for MCU target requires a memory dump of the running Executable in Intel Hex format.
It provides a tool to generate a script for IAR (IAR8 or IAR9) or GDB debugger, that contains the needed commands to dump the required memory regions in Intel Hex format.

.. _generate_vee_memory_dump_script:

Generate VEE memory dump script
-------------------------------

Open a shell terminal on your workstation and run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    java -DveePortDir=<path to VEE Port directory> \
        -Ddebugger.out.path=<path to the Executable file (application.out)> \
        -cp jdwp-server-[version].jar com.microej.jdwp.VeeDebuggerCli \
        --debugger=IAR8|IAR9|GDB \
        --output=<Output directory where the script file will be generated>

A script file named ``vee-memory-dump.mac`` (for IAR) or ``vee-memory-dump.gdb`` (for GDB) is generated into the specified output directory.

You can now use this script to dump the memory of the running Executable.

Dump the memory of the running Executable
-----------------------------------------

With IAR Debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    You must use a version of IAR Workbench for which the ``vee-memory-dump.mac`` script file is generated.

    A script file generated for IAR8 will not work on IAR Workbench 9.x.x and vice versa.
  
In IAR Embedded Workbench:

- Register the generated ``vee-memory-dump.mac`` script file in the debugger project option:
  
   #. Open the Debugger Project option window by clicking on ``Project > Options... > Debugger > Setup``
   #. Check the option ``Use macro file(s)`` and browse to the generated ``vee-memory-dump.mac`` file.
   #. Click on ``OK`` to confirm.
    
   .. figure:: images/iar-cspy1.png

      IAR Debugger Project Option

- Add the macro ``dumpMemories()`` as an action expression to a code breakpoint:

   #. Open IAR Breakpoints window by clicking on ``View > Breakpoints``
   #. Right click on IAR Breakpoints window and select ``New Breakpoint > Code``
   #. In the ``Expression`` text field, enter  ``dumpMemories()`` and click on ``OK``

   .. figure:: images/iar-cspy2.png
      :alt: IAR Breakpoint editor
      :align: center

      IAR Breakpoint editor

When the IAR Debugger hits the specified breakpoint, the ``dumpMemories()`` macro function is executed and the memory is dumped into ``*.hex`` files.

The ``*.hex`` files are generated in the same directory as the ``vee-memory-dump.mac`` file.

With GNU Debugger (GDB)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your GDB console:

- Create a breakpoint at a specific safe point (Core Engine hooks or native function)

.. code-block:: sh

    # E.g. Add breakpoint at LLMJVM_on_Runtime_gc_done hook
    break LLMJVM_on_Runtime_gc_done
    run

- When the running Executable stops at the Breakpoint, run the ``vee-memory-dump.gdb`` script file to dump the memory.

.. code-block:: sh

    # E.g. Run the GDB memory dump script
    source [/path/to]/vee-memory-dump.gdb

The memory is dumped into ``*.hex`` files in the same directory as the ``vee-memory-dump.gdb`` file.

Start the VEE Debugger Proxy
----------------------------

Open a shell terminal on your workstation and run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    java -DveePortDir=<path to VEE Port directory> \
        -Ddebugger.port=<8000> \
        -Ddebugger.out.path=<path to the Executable file (application.out)> \
        -Ddebugger.features.out.path=<comma-separated list of the Feature files with debug information (*.fodbg files). To be used if you want to debug an installed Sandboxed Application> \
        -Ddebugger.out.hex.path=<comma-separated list of the memory dump files in Intel Hex format or a single file containg all the dumped memory> \
        -jar jdwp-server-[version].jar

Open the SDK and run a :ref:`Remote Java Application Launch <debug_on_device>` to debug your code.


.. note:: 

    If you have multiple ``*.hex`` files generated in the previous step, you can if you want merge them into a single ``*.hex`` file.

    It will be easier to use a single ``*.hex`` file than multiple files in the Debugger Proxy command line.

    You can run the following shell script to merge all the ``*.hex`` files into a single file called ``all.hex`` for example.

    Make sure to move to the directory where ``*.hex`` files are generated before running the script.

    - On Windows workstation
  
    .. code-block:: batch
        
        set ALL_HEX="all.hex"
        rem delete all.hex file if it exists
        if exist "%ALL_HEX%" (del /f %ALL_HEX%)
        rem merge all the *.hex files
        copy /b *.hex %ALL_HEX%

    - On Linux workstation
  
    .. code-block:: bash

        #!/usr/bin/bash
        ALL_HEX="all.hex"
        #delete all.hex file if it exists
        test -f $ALL_HEX && rm $ALL_HEX
        #merge all the *.hex files
        cat *.hex > $ALL_HEX

    Now, use this single ``all.hex`` file as value to the Debugger Proxy option ``-Ddebugger.out.hex.path``

Update the state of the 'debugged' application
----------------------------------------------

While the VEE Debugger Proxy is running, and you want to debug your application using a new memory dump, you don't need to stop and restart the VEE Debugger Proxy. 
Simply overwrite the old memory dump files with the new ones, then relaunch the :ref:`Remote Java Application Launch <debug_on_device>`.


VEE Debugger Proxy Options Summary
==================================

* **veePortDir**: The path to the VEE Port directory (must point to the `source` folder of the VEE Port.).
* **debugger.port**: The TCP server port, defaults to ``8000``.
* **debugger.out.path**: The Path to the Executable file to debug (``application.out``).
* **debugger.features.out.path**: comma-separated list of the Feature files with debug information (``*.fodbg files``). This option must be used if you want to debug an installed Sandboxed Application. In this case, note that the specified Executable in ``debugger.out.path`` option must be the Multi-Sandbox Executable.
* **debugger.out.coredump.path**: The Path to the core dump file (conflict with **debugger.out.hex.path** option).
* **debugger.out.hex.path**: The Path to the memory dump files in Intel Hex format (conflict with **debugger.out.coredump.path** option).
  If you have multiple Intel Hex files, you can either merge them into a single file or list them with a comma separator, such as ``[/path/to]/java_heap.hex,[/path/to]/java_stacks.hex,[/path/to]/vm_instance.hex``.

Troubleshooting
===============

You may encounter some command line issues if you try to run the proxy on Windows Powershell. 

On Windows workstation, we recommend using ``CMD`` Command Prompt instead.
