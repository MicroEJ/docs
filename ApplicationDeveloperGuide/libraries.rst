Libraries
=========

A MicroEJ Foundation Library is a MicroEJ Core library that provides
core runtime APIs or hardware-dependent functionality. A Foundation
library is divided into an API and an implementation. A Foundation
library API is composed of a name and a 2 digits version (e.g.
``EDC-1.3``) and follows the semantic versioning (`<http://semver.org>`_)
specification. A Foundation Library API only contains prototypes without
code. Foundation Library implementations are provided by VEE Ports.
From a MicroEJ Classpath, Foundation Library APIs
dependencies are automatically mapped to the associated implementations
provided by the VEE Port or the Virtual Device on which the application
is being executed.

A MicroEJ Add-On Library is a MicroEJ library that is implemented on top
of MicroEJ Foundation Libraries (100% full Java code). A MicroEJ Add-On
Library is distributed in a single JAR file, with a 3 digits version and
provides its associated source code.

Foundation and Add-On Libraries are added to MicroEJ Classpath by the
application developer as module dependencies (see :ref:`mmm`).
