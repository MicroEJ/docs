Debug an Application
====================

To debug an application on Simulator, select it in the left panel then right-click
and select :guilabel:`Debug As` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ Application`.

It makes use of Eclipse Java debugger client.
If you are unfamiliar with Java debugging or Eclipse IDE, see `Debugging the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers`_ to get started.

All libraries included in MicroEJ SDK are provided with their source code and resources.
The way the sources are retrieved depends on the kind of library (Add-On Library or Foundation Library).

Add-On Library Sources
----------------------

Add-On Library sources are packaged in a dedicated file named ``[module_name]-source.jar`` available in the module directory:

In the SDK, sources are automatically connected to Eclipse JDT when the new Add-On Library is added as a :ref:`module dependency <mmm_module_dependencies>`.

On any Java element (type, method, field), press ``F3`` or ``CTRL-Click`` to open the implementation:

Then the implementation class is open in read-only mode.

.. _foundation_library_sources:

Foundation Library Sources
--------------------------

Foundation Library sources are directly included in the implementation file (JAR file) provided by the Platform.

They are located in the following Platform folders:

- :guilabel:`javaLibs` for generic Foundation Libraries (defaults).
- :guilabel:`MICROJVM/javaLibs` for Foundation Libraries specific to the MicroEJ Core Engine.
- :guilabel:`S3/javaLibs` for Foundation Libraries specific to the Simulator.

      Foundation Library Platform Folders
   
In the SDK, sources can be connected while debugging an Application on Simulator.
This ensures to get the exact source code which is executed on your Platform.

Here are the steps to attach Foundation Library sources from a Platform loaded in the workspace:

- Open a :ref:`MicroEJ Application launch <concepts-microejlaunches>`,

- Select the :guilabel:`Source` tab (see also :ref:`launch_source_tab`), 

- Click on :guilabel:`Add...` button,

- Select :guilabel:`Archive` item and press :guilabel:`OK`,

- Select the Foundation Libraries from Platform folders and press :guilabel:`OK`,

      Select Foundation Libraries Implementation files 

   .. warning::

      You must select the libraries from the Platform project corresponding to the execution Platform (see :ref:`launch_execution_tab`).

In the debug session the implementation sources will be now displayed.
