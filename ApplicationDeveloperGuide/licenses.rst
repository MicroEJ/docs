MicroEJ Architectures are distributed in two different versions:

- Evaluation Architectures, associated with a software license key 
- Production Architectures, associated with an hardware license key stored on a USB dongle 

Licenses list is available in MicroEJ preferences dialog page in :guilabel:`Window`
> :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ`

Note that :

-  Evaluation licenses will be shown only if architectures requiring an
   evaluation license are detected in your MicroEJ repository.

-  Production licenses will be shown only if architectures requiring a
   production license are detected in your MicroEJ repository.

See section :ref:`gettingstarted-installlicenses` for more
information.

For more information about the licenses protection, please refer to
section :ref:`concepts-licenses`.

Evaluation Licenses
-------------------

This section should be considered when using evaluation platforms, which
use software license keys.

.. _gettingstarted-installlicenseseval-uid:

Generating Machine UID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To activate an evaluation platform, a machine UID needs to be provided
to the key server. This information is available from the :guilabel:`Window` >
:guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ` > :guilabel:`Architectures` or :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ`
> :guilabel:`Platforms` preferences page. Click on one of the available architectures or platforms and press the :guilabel:`Get UID` button to get the generated machine identifier.

.. note:: At least one Platform or Architecture must have been imported to access this :guilabel:`Get UID` option. See section :ref:`download.hardware.simulator` for more information.

Copy the UID. It will be needed when requesting a license.

- Insert the USB dongle into a USB port of a Windows computer.
- Launch the executable program.
- Click on the :guilabel:`Update` button (no password needed)
- USB dongle will be updated when “Successfully updated” dialog box appears.

Check activation on MicroEJ SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Go back to MicroEJ SDK.
- Select the :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ` menu.
- Go to the :guilabel:`Architectures` sub-menu and check that all production architectures are now activated (green check).
- Your MicroEJ SDK is successfully activated.


.. _dongles-update:

USB Dongles Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains instructions that will allow to flash your
hardware dongle with the proper activation key.

You shall ensure that the following prerequisites are met :

-  The USB dongle is plugged and recognized by your operating system
   (see :ref:`dongles-recognition` section)

-  No more than one dongle is plugged to the computer while running the
   update tool

-  The update tool is not launched from a Network drive or from a USB
   key

-  The activation key you downloaded is the one for the dongle UID on
   the sticker attached to the dongle (each activation key is tied to
   the unique hardware ID of the dongle).

You can then proceed to the dongle update by running the activation key
executable. Just press :guilabel:`Update` (no key is required).

   Dongle Update Tool

On success, an ``Update successfully`` message shall appear. On failure, an
``Error key or no proper rockey`` message may appear.

.. figure:: images/dongle/updateSuccessful.png

   Successful dongle update

Once you have successfully updated your dongle, from MicroEJ, go to
:guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ` > :guilabel:`Platforms`. You shall see that the
license status for the platforms you installed with the ``License tag``
matching the one on the sticker attached to your USB dongle has turned
from a red cross to a green tick.

.. _dongles-recognition:

USB Dongles Recognition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains instructions that will allow to check that your
hardware dongle is actually recognized by your operating system

.. _troubleshooting-linux:

GNU/Linux Troubleshooting
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

For GNU/Linux Users (Ubuntu at least), by default, the dongle access has
not been granted to the user, you have to modify udev rules. Please
create a ``/etc/udev/rules.d/91-usbdongle.rules`` file with the
following contents:

::

   ACTION!="add", GOTO="usbdongle_end"
       SUBSYSTEM=="usb", GOTO="usbdongle_start"
       SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", GOTO="usbdongle_start"
       GOTO="usbdongle_end"
       
       LABEL="usbdongle_start"
       
       ATTRS{idVendor}=="096e" , ATTRS{idProduct}=="0006" , MODE="0666"
       
       LABEL="usbdongle_end"

Then, restart udev: ``/etc/init.d/udev restart``

You can check that the device is recognized by running the ``lsusb``
command. The output of the command should contain a line similar to the
one below for each dongle :
``Bus 002 Device 003: ID 096e:0006 Feitian Technologies, Inc.``

Windows Troubleshooting
"""""""""""""""""""""""

For Windows users, each dongle shall be recognized with the following
hardware ID :

::

   HID\VID_096E&PID_0006&REV_0109

On Windows 8.1, go to :guilabel:`Device Manager` > :guilabel:`Human Interface Devices` and
check among the ``USB Input Device`` entries that the
``Details`` > ``Hardware Ids`` property match the ID mentioned before.

VirtualBox Troubleshooting
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In a VirtualBox virtual machine, USB drives must be enabled to be recognized correctly.
So make sure to enable the USB dongle by clicking on it in the VirtualBox menu ``Devices`` > ``USB``.

In order to make this setting persistent, go to ``Devices`` > ``USB`` > ``USB Settings...`` 
and add the USB dongle in the ``USB Devices Filters`` list.

Production License Key Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If you did not received an activation certificate, please contact the support@microej.com.
- Check that you have your Activation Key.
- Check that your dongle is activated.
- In the SDK, in :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ`,

   - Check that the dongle appears on the ``Licenses`` list.

       - If not, check that the dongle is plugged in your computer. If using Linux :ref:`please configure the USB rules <troubleshooting-linux>`.

   - In :guilabel:`Architectures` tab check that some Production Architectures are available.

- Errors may occurs when launching the activation tool from a server mounted FS, copy it to your desktop before.
