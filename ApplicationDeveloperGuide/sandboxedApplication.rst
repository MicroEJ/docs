A Sandboxed Application is a Java Application that can run over a Multi-Sandbox Firmware.
Sandboxed Applications can be linked statically to the Multi-Sandbox Firmware or installed dynamically on the device.

Typical use cases for a Sandboxed Application are:

- over the air provisioning: the Application is dynamically installed or updated on a fleet of heterogenous devices.
- modularization: a monolithic application is split into multiple Sandboxed Applications; each of them can be started or stopped separately.

The Application development flow requires the following elements:

- a Virtual Device, a software package including the resources and tools required for building and testing an application for a specific device.
  A Virtual Device will simulate all capabilities of the corresponding hardware board:

  - Computation and Memory
  - Communication channels (e.g. Network, USB ...)
  - Display
  - User interaction

- an hardware device that has been previously programmed with a Multi-Sandbox Firmware. 
  Virtual Devices and Multi-Sandbox Firmware share the same version (there is a 1:1 mapping).

Please refer to the :ref:`kernel-developer-guide` to learn more on writing Kernel Applications and building Multi-Sandbox Firmware and Virtual Devices.

The next chapters explain how to create, test and publish Sandboxed Applications.
