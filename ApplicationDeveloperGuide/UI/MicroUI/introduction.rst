MicroUI Foundation Library provides access to a pixel-based display and inputs.

The aim of this library is to enable the creation of user interface in Java by reifying hardware capabilities.

To use the MicroUI Foundation Library, add `MicroUI API module`_ to a :ref:`module description file <mmm_module_description>`:

.. code-block:: XML

	<dependency org="ej.api" name="microui" rev="3.1.0"/>

Drawing Foundation Library extends MicroUI drawing APIs [#note_microui_2]_ with more complex ones such as:

- thick line, arc, circle and ellipse

To use the Drawing Foundation Library, add `Drawing API module`_ to a :ref:`module description file <mmm_module_description>`:
