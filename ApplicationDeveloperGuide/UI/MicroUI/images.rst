Images
======

Overview
--------

Images are graphical resources that can be accessed with a call to `ej.microui.display.Image.getImage() <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/microui/display/Image.html#getImage-java.lang.String->`_ or `ej.microui.display.ResourceImage.loadImage() <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/microui/display/ResourceImage.html#loadImage-java.lang.String->`_. To be displayed, these
images have to be converted from their source format to the display raw
format. The conversion can either be done at:

-  build-time (using the image generator tool),

-  run-time (using the relevant decoder library).

Images that must be processed by the image generator tool are declared
in :ref:`MicroEJ Classpath<chapter.microej.classpath>` ``*.images.list`` files. The file format is a
standard Java properties file, each line representing a ``/`` separated
resource path relative to the MicroEJ classpath root referring to a
standard image file (e.g. ``.png``, ``.jpg``). The resource may be
followed by an optional parameter (separated by a ``:``) which defines
and/or describes the image output file format (raw format). When no
option is specified, the image is embedded as-is and will be decoded at
run-time (although listing files without format specifier has no impact
on the image generator processing, it is advised to specify them in the
``*.images.list`` files anyway, as it makes the run-time processing
behavior explicit). Example:

::

   # The following image is embedded 
   # as a PNG resource (decoded at run-time)
   com/mycompany/MyImage1.png

   # The following image is embedded 
   # as a 16 bits format without transparency (decoded at build-time)
   com/mycompany/MyImage2.png:RGB565

   # The following image is embedded 
   # as a 16 bits format with transparency (decoded at build-time)
   com/mycompany/MyImage3.png:ARGB1555

Configuration File
------------------

Here is the format of the ``*.images.list`` files.

::

   ConfigFile          ::= Line [ 'EOL' Line ]*
   Line                ::= ImagePath [ ':' ImageOption ]*
   ImagePath           ::= Identifier [ '/' Identifier ]*
   ImageOption         ::= [^:]*
   Identifier          ::= Letter [ LetterOrDigit ]*
   Letter              ::= 'a-zA-Z_$'
   LetterOrDigit       ::= 'a-zA-Z_$0-9'

Images Heap
-----------

The images heap is used to allocate the pixel data of:

- mutable images (i.e. `BufferedImage <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/microui/display/BufferedImage.html>`_  instances)
- images which are not byte-addressable, such as images opened with an input stream
- images which are byte-addressable but converted to a different output format

In other words, every image which can not be retrieved using `Image.getImage() <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/microui/display/Image.html#getImage-java.lang.String->`_  is saved on the images heap.

The size of the images heap can be configured with the ``ej.microui.memory.imagesheap.size`` property.

Output Formats
--------------

Without Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When no output format is set in the images list file, the image is
embedded without any conversion / compression. This allows you to embed
the resource as well, in order to keep the source image characteristics
(compression, bpp, etc.). This option produces the same result as
specifiying an image as a resource in the MicroEJ launcher.

Advantages:

- Preserves the image characteristics;
- Preserves the original image compression.

Disadvantages:

- Requires an image runtime decoder;
- Requires some RAM in which to store the decoded image;
- Requires execution time to decode the image.

Standard Output Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the target hardware, several generic output formats are
available. Some formats may be directly managed by the BSP display
driver. Refer to the platform specification to retrieve the list of
natively supported formats.

Advantages:

-  The pixels layout and bits format are standard, so it is easy to
   manipulate these images on the C-side;

-  Drawing an image is very fast when the display driver recognizes the
   format (with or without transparency);

-  Supports or not the alpha encoding: select the most suitable format
   for the image to encode.

Disadvantages:

- No compression: the image size in bytes is proportional to the number   of pixels, the transparency, and the bits-per-pixel;
- Slower than ``display`` format when the display driver does not recognize the  format: a pixel conversion is required at runtime.

Select one the following format to use a generic format among this list: ``ARGB8888``, ``RGB888``, ``ARGB4444``, ``ARGB1555``, ``RGB565``, ``A8``, ``A4``, ``A2``, ``A1``, ``C4``, ``C2``, ``C1``, ``AC44``, ``AC22`` and ``AC11``. The following snippets describe the color conversion for each format:

-  ARGB8888: 32 bits format, 8 bits for transparency, 8 per color.

              ;
      }

Display Output Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This format encodes the image into the exact display memory
representation. If the image to encode contains some transparent pixels,
the output file will embed the transparency according to the display's
implementation capacity. When all pixels are fully opaque, no extra
information will be stored in the output file in order to free up some
memory space.

.. note:: When the display memory representation is standard, the display output format is automatically replaced by a standard format.

Advantages:

-  Drawing an image is very fast because no pixel conversion is required at runtime;

-  Supports alpha encoding when display pixel format allow it.

Disadvantages:

-  No compression: the image size in bytes is proportional to the number
   of pixels.

::

   image1:display


RLE1 Output Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The image engine can display embedded images that are encoded into a compressed format which encodes several consecutive pixels into one or
more 16-bit words. This encoding manages a maximum alpha level of 2
(alpha level is always assumed to be 2, even if the image is not
transparent).

-  Several consecutive pixels have the same color (2 words):

   -  First 16-bit word specifies how many consecutive pixels have the
      same color (pixels colors converted in RGB565 format, without opacity data).

   -  Second 16-bit word is the pixels' color in RGB565 format.

-  Several consecutive pixels have their own color (1 + n words):

   -  First 16-bit word specifies how many consecutive pixels have their
      own color;

   -  Next 16-bit word is the next pixel color.

-  Several consecutive pixels are transparent (1 word):

   -  16-bit word specifies how many consecutive pixels are transparent.

Advantages:

-  Supports fully opaque and fully transparent encoding.

-  Good compression when several consecutive pixels respect one of the
   three previous rules.

Disadvantages:

-  Drawing an image is slightly slower than when using Display format.
- Not designed for images with many different pixel colors: in such case, the output file size may be larger than the original image file.
