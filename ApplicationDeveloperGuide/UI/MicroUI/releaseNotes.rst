Migration Guide
===============

The MicroUI implementation is provided by the MicroEJ UI Pack.
According the MicroEJ UI Pack used to build the MicroEJ Platform, the application has to be updated.

* Refer to the :ref:`table <section_ui_api>` that illustrates the implemented MicroUI API for each MicroEJ UI Pack.
* Refer to the latest `MicroUI API Changelog <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/microui>`_.
* Refer to the latest `Drawing API Changelog <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/drawing>`_.

The following chapters describe the changes to perform in the application according the MicroEJ UI Pack used to build the MicroEJ Platform.

From 12.x to 13.x
=================

* Update `ej.api#microui <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/microui/>`_ dependency to the latest available version ``3.x``.
* Add `ej.api#drawing <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/drawing/>`_ dependency.
