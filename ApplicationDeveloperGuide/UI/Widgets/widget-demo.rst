Widget Demo
===========

The widget demo provides some widget implementations as well as usage examples for these widgets and for the widgets of the Widget library.
The widgets and usage examples are intended to be duplicated by the developers in order to be adapted to their use-case.

Source
------

To use the widgets provided by the widget demo, clone the following GitHub repository: `<https://github.com/MicroEJ/Demo-Widget>`_.
You can then import the ``com.microej.demo.widget`` project into your workspace to see the source of the widgets and their associated examples.

Each subpackage contains the source code for a specific widget and for a page which showcases the widget.
For example, the ``com.microej.demo.widget.checkbox`` package contains the ``Checkbox`` widget and the ``CheckboxPage``.

Provided Widgets
----------------

The showcased widgets are listed in the `README <https://github.com/MicroEJ/Demo-Widget/blob/master/com.microej.demo.widget/README.md>`_ of the project.
