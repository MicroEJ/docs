How to Debug

Highlighting the Bounds of the Widgets
--------------------------------------

When designing a UI, it can be pretty convenient to highlight the bounds of each widget.
Here are some cases where it helps:

- Verify if the layout fits the expected design.
- Set the outlines (margin, padding, border).
- Check the alignment of the widget content inside its bounds.

Setting the ``ej.mwt.debug.bounds.enabled`` constant to ``true`` will add a rectangle overlay over each widget and container.
For more information about constants, see the :ref:`section.classpath.elements.constants` section.

By default, the rectangles around the widgets are magenta.
But their color can be adjusted by modifying the ``ej.mwt.debug.bounds.color`` constant.

Here is an example of a ``xxx.constants.list`` file with the result in an application:

.. code-block::

	ej.mwt.debug.bounds.enabled=true
	ej.mwt.debug.bounds.color=0x00ff00

.. figure:: images/highlightWidgetList.png
	:alt: Highlight widgets in a list
	:align: center
 
.. figure:: images/highlightWidgetWheel.png
	:alt: Highlight widgets in a wheel
	:align: center
