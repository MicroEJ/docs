Motion
======

Motion is a library that provides some of the most commonly used easing functions and allows users to define new ones.

Easing functions help to mimic the movement of real objects, which allows for the creation of appealing visual animations.
The library can also be useful for other purposes such as defining non-linear gradients for example.
