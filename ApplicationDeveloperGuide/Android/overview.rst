Overview
========

The MicroEJ Android Compatibility Kit is composed of two main components:

* A runtime: applications developed on MicroEJ can run on the Android platform thanks to the Android-based implementation of the MicroEJ Foundation libraries and dedicated support libraries.
* A developer kit: the SDK 6 and a Gradle plugin enable support for developing applications in Android Studio with Gradle.
