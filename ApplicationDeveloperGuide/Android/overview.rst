Overview
========

MicroEJ provides a set of tools and libraries to run applications powered by MicroEJ on Android and Wear OS.
This allows for the same application to be developed, simulated, tested, and run on Android and MicroEJ VEE alike.

Having the same code ready for both Android and MicroEJ VEE opens up a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to:

* develop derivative products based on small MCUs or low-cost MPUs that cannot support Android due to their constrained resources.
* dramatically reduce energy consumption by enabling two processors to coexist to distribute tasks between a very powerful processor powered by Android and a low-power processor powered by MicroEJ.

Typical examples of these
