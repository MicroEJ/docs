Tests
=====

JavaScript applications can be tested with tests written in JavaScript.
The JavaScript test files must be located in the project folder ``src/test/js``.
All JavaScript files (``*.js``) found in this folder, at any level, are considered as test files.

In order to setup JavaScript tests for your application, follow these steps:

- create an :ref:`Add-On Library <libraries>` project or a :ref:`Standalone Application <standalone_application>` project
- define the following configuration in the build file of the project:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Gradle (build.gradle.kts)

      .. code-block:: java
      
         tasks.test {
            filter {
               includeTestsMatching("*._JsTest_*Code")
            }
         }

   .. tab:: MMM (module.ivy)

      Add these properties nside the ``ea:build`` tag (if the properties already exist, replace them):

      .. code-block:: xml

         <ea:property name="test.run.includes.pattern" value="**/_JsTest_*Code.class"/>
         <ea:property name="target.main.classes" value="${basedir}/target~/test/classes"/>

- add the MicroEJ JavaScript dependency in the build file of the project:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Gradle (build.gradle.kts)

      .. code-block:: java

         implementation("com.microej.library.runtime:js:0.13.0")

   .. tab:: MMM (module.ivy)

      .. code-block:: xml

         <dependency org="com.microej.library.runtime" name="js" rev="0.13.0"/>

- define the platform to use to run the tests with one of the options described in :ref:`platform_selection` section
- create a file ``assert.js`` in the folder ``src/test/resources`` with the following content:

.. code-block:: javascript

	var assertionCount = 0;

	function assert(value) {
		assertionCount++;
		if (value == 0) {
			print("assert " + assertionCount + " - FAILED");
		} else {
			print("assert " + assertionCount + " - PASSED");
		}
	}

This method ``assert`` will be available in all tests to do assertions.

- create a file ``test.js`` in the folder ``src/test/js`` and write your first test:

.. code-block:: javascript

	var a = 5;
	var b = 3;
	var sum = a + b;
	assert(sum === 8);

- build the application in the SDK or in command line with the :ref:`MMM CLI <mmm_build_kit>`

The execution of the tests produces a report available in the folder ``target~/test/html`` for the project.
