Build the WPK
-------------

When the application is ready for deployment, the last step 
is to create the WPK (Wadapps PacKage) file that is intended to
be published on a MicroEJ Forge instance for end users.

In the SDK, right-click on the Sandboxed Application project name
and select ``Build Module``.

The WPK build process will display messages in MicroEJ console, ending
up the following message:

::

    [echo] project hello published locally with version 0.1.0-RC201907091602

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL

    Total time: 1 minute 6 seconds

The WPK file produced by the build process is located in a dedicated
``target~/artifacts`` folder in the project and is published to the target module repository declared in :ref:`MicroEJ Module Manager settings file <mmm_settings_file>`.

The module repository can be a `MicroEJ Forge instance <https://www.microej.com/product/forge/>`_.
