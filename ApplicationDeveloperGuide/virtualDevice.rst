Using a Virtual Device for Simulation
-------------------------------------

The Virtual Device includes the same custom MicroEJ Core, libraries and
System Applications as the real device. The Virtual Device allows
developers to run their applications either on the Simulator, or
directly on the real device through local deployment.

The Simulator runs a mockup board support package (BSP Mock) that mimics
the hardware functionality. An application on the Simulator is run as a
Standalone Application.

Before an application is locally deployed on device, the SDK
ensures that it does not depend on any API that is unavailable on the
device.

The set of MicroEJ APIs exposed by a Virtual Device (and therefore
provided by its associated firwmare) is documented in Javadoc format, please consult https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/.
