=========================
ELF to Map File Generator
=========================


Principle
=========

The ELF to Map generator takes an ELF executable file and generates a
MicroEJ compliant ``.map`` file. Thus, any ELF executable file produced
by third party linkers can be analyzed and interpreted using the
:ref:`memorymapanalyzer`.
