Code Coverage Analyzer
======================


Principle
=========

The MicroEJ Simulator features an option to output .cc (Code Coverage)
files that represent the use rate of functions of an application. It
traces how the opcodes are really executed.


Functional Description
======================

The Code Coverage Analyzer scans the output .cc files, and outputs an
HTML report to ease the analysis of methods coverage. The HTML report is
available in a folder named htmlReport in the same folder as the .cc
files generated by enabling the :ref:`Code Coverage option <category.code.coverage>` .

Dependencies
============

In order to work properly, the Code Coverage Analyzer should input the
.cc files. The .cc files relay the classpath used during the execution
of the Simulator to the Code Coverage Analyzer. Therefore the classpath
is considered to be a dependency of the Code Coverage Analyzer.


Installation
============

This tool is a built-in platform tool.
