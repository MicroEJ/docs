Fundamental Concepts
====================

Multi-Sandboxing is based on the :ref:`the Kernel & Features Specification <kf_specification>` (KF).

It allows an application code to be split between multiples parts: 

- the main application, called the Kernel,
- zero or more applications called Features.

Therefore, in the next chapters, a Kernel Application relates to the *Kernel* concept, and a Sandboxed Application relates to the *Feature* concept.

Some fundamental points:

- The Kernel is mandatory. It is assumed to be reliable, trusted and cannot be modified.
- A Feature is an application "extension" managed by the Kernel.
- A Feature is fully controlled by the Kernel: it can be installed (dynamically or statically pre-installed), started, stopped and
  uninstalled at any time independent of the system state (particularly, a Feature never depends on
  another Feature to be stopped).
- A Feature is optional, potentially not-trusted, maybe unreliable and
  can be executed without jeopardizing the safety of the Kernel execution and other Features.
- Resources accesses (RAM, hardware peripherals, CPU time, ...) are under control of the Kernel.
