Limitations
===========

The following table lists the limitations of MicroEJ Architectures version ``7.14.0`` or higher, for both Evaluation and Production usage.
Please consult the `MicroEJ Architecture Release Notes <https://repository.microej.com/architectures/RELEASE-NOTES-Architecture.md>`_ for limitations changes on former versions.

.. note::
 
   The term `unlimited` means there is no Architecture specific limitation. However, there may be limitations driven by device memory layout.   
   Please refer to Platform specific documentation to get the memory mapping of :ref:`MicroEJ Core Engine sections <core_engine_link>`.

.. [1]
   Concrete types are classes and arrays that can be instantiated.
   
.. [2]
   All instance fields declared in the class and its super classes.

.. [3]
   The maximum number of different monitors that can be held by one thread at any
   time is defined by the :ref:`maximum number of monitors per thread Application option <option_maximum_number_of_monitors_per_thread>`.

.. [4]
   The Java heap Garbage Collection limit may throw unexpected cascading `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/java/lang/OutOfMemoryError.html>`_ exceptions before the MicroEJ Core Engine exits.
