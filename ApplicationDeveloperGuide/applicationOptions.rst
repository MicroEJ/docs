Application Options
###################

To run a MicroEJ Standalone Application on a MicroEJ Platform, a set of options
must be defined. Options can be of different types:

- Memory Allocation options (e.g set the Java Heap size). These options are usually called link-time options.
- Simulator & Debug options (e.g. enable periodic Java Heap dump).
- Deployment options (e.g. copy ``microejapp.o`` to a suitable BSP location).
- Foundation Library specific options (e.g. embed UTF-8 encoding).

The following section describes options provided by MicroEJ Architecture.
Please consult the appropriate MicroEJ Pack documentation for options related to other Foundation Libraries (MicroUI, NET, SSL, FS, ...) integrated to the Platform.

Notice that some options may not be available, in the following cases:

- Option is specific to the MicroEJ Core Engine capability (*tiny*/*single*/*multi*) which is integrated in the targeted Platform.
- Option is specific to the target (MicroEJ Core Engine on Device or Simulator).
- Option has been introduced in a newer version of the MicroEJ Architecture which is integrated in the targeted Platform.
- Options related to :ref:`Board Support Package (BSP) connection <bsp_connection_application_options>`.
