Testsuite with JUnit
====================

MicroEJ allows to run unit tests using the standard JUnit API during the
build process of a MicroEJ library or a MicroEJ Application. The MicroEJ
testsuite engine runs tests on a target Platform and outputs a JUnit XML
report.

Principle
---------

JUnit testing can be enabled when using the ``microej-javalib`` (MicroEJ
Add-On Library) or the ``microej-application`` (MicroEJ Applications)
build type. JUnit test cases processing is automatically enabled when
the following dependency is declared in the ``module.ivy`` file of the
project.

::

   <dependency conf="test->*" org="ej.library.test" name="junit" rev="1.5.0"/>

When a new JUnit test case class is created in the ``src/test/java``
folder, a JUnit processor generates MicroEJ compliant classes into a
specific source folder named ``src-adpgenerated/junit/java``. These
files are automatically managed and must not be edited manually.

JUnit Compliance
----------------

MicroEJ is compliant with a subset of JUnit version 4. MicroEJ JUnit
processor supports the following annotations: ``@After``,
``@AfterClass``, ``@Before``, ``@BeforeClass``, ``@Ignore``, ``@Test``.

Each test case entry point must be declared using the ``org.junit.Test``
annotation (``@Test`` before a method declaration). Please refer to
JUnit documentation to get details on usage of other annotations.

Setup a Platform for Tests
--------------------------

Before running tests, a target platform must be configured in the
MicroEJ workspace. The following steps assume that a platform has been
previously imported into the MicroEJ Platform repository.

Go to :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ` >
:guilabel:`Platforms` and select the desired platform on which to run the tests.

Press :kbd:`F2` to expand the details.

Select the the platform path and copy it to the clipboard.

Go to :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`Ant` >
:guilabel:`Runtime` and select the :guilabel:`Properties` tab.

Click on :guilabel:`Add Property...` button and set a new property named
``target.platform.dir`` with the platform path pasted from the
clipboard.

Setup a Project with a JUnit Test Case
--------------------------------------

This section describes how to create a new JUnit Test Case starting from
a new MicroEJ library project.

Select :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`New` > :guilabel:`Project...` >
:guilabel:`EasyAnt` > :guilabel:`EasyAnt Project`.

Press :guilabel:`Next`. Fill out project settings and select the
``microej-javalib`` skeleton A new project named ``mylibrary`` is
created in the workspace.

Right-click on the ``src/test/java`` folder and select :guilabel:`New` >
:guilabel:`Other...` menu item.

Select the :guilabel:`Java` > :guilabel:`JUnit` > :guilabel:`New JUnit Test Case`
wizard. Enter a test name and press :guilabel:`Finish`. A new JUnit test case
class is created with a default failing test case.

Build and Run a JUnit Testsuite
-------------------------------

Right-click on the ``mylibrary`` project and select :guilabel:`Build with EasyAnt`.
After the library is built, the testsuite engine launches available test cases
and the build process fails in the console view.

On the ``mylibrary`` project, right-click and select :guilabel:`Refresh`.

A ``target~`` folder appears with intermediate build files. The JUnit
report is available at ``target~\test\xml\TEST-test-report.xml``.

Double-click on the file to open the JUnit testsuite report.

Modify the test case by replacing

::

   fail("Not yet implemented");

with

::

   Assert.assertTrue(true);

Right-click again on the ``mylibrary`` project and select :guilabel:`Build with EasyAnt`.
The test is now successfully executed on the target platform so the MicroEJ Add-On Library is fully built and published without errors.

Double-click on the JUnit testsuite report to see the test has been
successfully executed.

Advanced Configurations
-----------------------

Autogenerated Test Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JUnit processor generates test classes into the
``src-adpgenerated/junit/java`` folder. This folder contains:

``_AllTestClasses.java`` file
    A single class with a main enty point that sequentially calls all declared
    test methods of all JUnit test case classes.

``_AllTests_[TestCase].java`` files
    For each JUnit test case class, a class with a main entry point that
    sequentially calls all declared test methods.

``_SingleTest_[TestCase]_[TestMethod].java`` files
    For each test method of each JUnit test case class, a class with a main
    entry point that calls the test method.

JUnit Test Case to MicroEJ Test Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MicroEJ testsuite engine allows to select the classes that will be
executed, by setting the following property in the project
``module.ivy`` file.

::

   <ea:property name="test.run.includes.pattern" value="[MicroEJ Test Case Include Pattern]"/>

The following line consider all JUnit test methods of the same class as
a single MicroEJ test case (default behaviour). If at least one JUnit
test method fails, the whole test case fails in the JUnit report.

::

   <ea:property name="test.run.includes.pattern" value="**/_AllTests_*.class"/>

The following line consider each JUnit test method as a dedicated
MicroEJ test case. Each test method is viewed independently in the JUnit
report, but this may slow down the testsuite execution because a new
deployment is done for each test method.

::

   <ea:property name="test.run.includes.pattern" value="**/_SingleTest_*.class"/>

Run a Single Test Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each test can be run independently as each class contains a main entry
point.

In the ``src-adpgenerated/junit/java`` folder, right-click on the desired
autogenerated class (``_SingleTest_[TestCase]_[TestMethod].java``) and select
:guilabel:`Run As` > :guilabel:`MicroEJ Application`.

The test is executed on the selected Platform and the output result is
dumped into the console.

Test Specific Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MicroEJ testsuite engine allows to define MicroEJ Launch options
specific to each test case. This can be done by defining a file with the
same name as the generated test case file with the ``.properties``
extension instead of the ``.java`` extension. The file must be put in
the ``src/test/resources`` folder and within the same package than the
test case file.

Consult the Application Launch Options Appendix of the Device
Developer's Guide to get the list of available options properties.
