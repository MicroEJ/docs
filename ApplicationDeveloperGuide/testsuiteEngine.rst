Testsuite Engine
================


.. _testsuite-definition:

Definition
----------

The MicroEJ Testsuite is an engine made for validating any development
project using automatic testing. The MicroEJ Testsuite engine allows
the user to test any kind of projects within the configuration of a
generic ant file.


.. _testsuite-command-ant:

Using the MicroEJ Testsuite Ant tasks
--------------------------------------

Multiple Ant tasks are available in the testsuite-engine provided jar:

-  ``testsuite`` allows the user to run a given testsuite and to
   retrieve an XML report document in a JUnit format.

-  ``javaTestsuite`` is a subtask of the ``testsuite`` task, used to run
   a specialized testsuite for Java (will only run Java classes).

-  ``htmlReport`` is a task which will generate an HTML report from a
   list of JUnit report files.

.. _testsuite-command-ant-runtestsuite:

The testsuite Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This task have some mandatory attributes to fill:

-  ``outputDir``: the output folder of the testsuite. The final report
   will be generated at ``[outputDir]/[label]/[reportName].xml``, see
   the ``testsuiteReportFileProperty`` and
   ``testsuiteReportDirProperty`` attributes.

-  ``harnessScript``: the harness script must be an Ant script and it is
   the script which will be called for each test by the testsuite
   engine. It is called with a ``basedir`` located at output location of
   the current test. The testsuite engine will provide to it some
   properties giving all the informations to start the test:

   -  ``testsuite.test.name``: The output name of the current test in
      the report. Default value is the relative path of the test. It can
      be manually set by the user. More details on the output name are
      available in the section
      :ref:`testsuite-various-customproperties`.

   -  ``testsuite.test.path``: The current test absolute path in the
      filesystem.

   -  ``testsuite.test.properties``: The absolute path to the custom
      properties of the current test (see the property
      ``customPropertiesExtension``)

   -  ``testsuite.common.properties``: The absolute path to the common
      properties of all the tests (see the property
      ``commonProperties``)

   -  ``testsuite.report.dir``: The absolute path to the directory of
      the final report.

Some attributes are optional, and if not set by the user, a default
value will be attributed.

-  ``timeOut``: the time in seconds before any test is considerated as
   unknown. Set it to 0 to disable the time-out. Will be defaulted as
   60.

-  ``verboseLevel``: the required level to output messages from the
   testsuite. Can be one of those values: error, warning, info,
   verbose, debug. Will be defaulted as info.

-  ``reportName``: the final report name (without extension). Default
   value is ``testsuite-report``.

-  ``customPropertiesExtension``: the extension of the custom properties
   for each test. For instance, if it is set to ``.options``, a test
   named ``xxx/Test1.class`` will be associated with
   ``xxx/Test1.options``. If a file exists for a test, the property
   ``testsuite.test.properties`` is set with its absolute path and given
   to the ``harnessScript``. If the test path references a directory,
   then the custom properties path is the concatenation of the test path
   and the ``customPropertiesExtension`` value. By default, custom
   properties extension is ``.properties``.

-  ``commonProperties``: the properties to apply to every test of the
   testsuite. Those options might be overridden by the custom
   properties of each test. If this option is set and the file exists,
   the property ``testsuite.common.properties`` is set to the absolute
   path of the ``harnessScript`` file. By default, there is not any
   common properties.

-  ``label``: the build label. Will be generated as a timestamp by the
   testsuite if not set.

-  ``productName``: the name of the current tested product. Default
   value is ``TestSuite``.

-  ``jvm``: the location of your Java VM to start the testsuite (the
   ``harnessScript`` is called as is:
   ``[jvm] [...] -buildfile [harnessScript]``). Will be defaulted as
   your ``java.home`` location if the property is set, or to ``java``.

-  ``jvmargs``: the arguments to pass to the Java VM started for each
   test.

-  ``testsuiteReportFileProperty``: the name of the Ant property in
   which is stored the path of the final report. Default value is
   ``testsuite.report.file`` and path is
   ``[outputDir]/[label]/[reportName].xml``

-  ``testsuiteReportDirProperty``: the name of the Ant property in which
   is store the path of the directory of the final report. Default value
   is ``testsuite.report.dir`` and path is ``[outputDir]/[label]``

-  ``testsuiteResultProperty``: the name of the Ant property in which
   you want to have the result of the testsuite (true or false),
   depending if every tests successfully passed the testsuite or not.
   Ignored tests do not affect this result.

Finally, you have to give as nested element the path containing the
tests.

-  ``testPath``: containing all the file of the tests which will be
   launched by the testsuite.

-  ``testIgnoredPath`` (optional): Any test in the intersection between
   ``testIgnoredPath`` and ``testPath`` will be executed by the
   testsuite, but will not appear in the JUnit final report. It will
   still generate a JUnit report for each test, which will allow the
   HTML report to let them appears as "ignored" if it is generated.
   Mostly used for known bugs which are not considered as failure but
   still relevant enough to appears on the HTML report.

.. _testsuite-command-ant-runjavatestsuite:

The javaTestsuite Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This task extends the ``testsuite`` task, specializing the testsuite to
only start real Java class. This task will retrieve the classname of the
tests from the classfile and will provide new properties to the harness
script:

-  ``testsuite.test.class``: The classname of the current test. The
   value of the property ``testsuite.test.name`` is also set to the
   classname of the current test.

-  ``testsuite.test.classpath``: The classpath of the current test.

.. _testsuite-command-ant-generatereport:

The htmlReport Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This task allow the user to transform a given path containing a sample
of JUnit reports to an HTML detailled report. Here is the attributes to
fill:

-  A nested fileset containing all the JUnit reports of each test. Take
   care to exclude the final JUnit report generated by the testsuite.

-  A nested element ``report``

   -  ``format``: The format of the generated HTML report. Must be
      ``noframes`` or ``frames``. When ``noframes`` format is choosen, a
      standalone HTML file is generated.

   -  ``todir``: The output folder of your HTML report.

   -  The ``report`` tag accepts the nested tag ``param`` with ``name``
      and ``expression`` attributes. These tags can pass XSL parameters
      to the stylesheet. The built-in stylesheets support the following
      parameters:

      -  ``PRODUCT``: the product name that is displayed in the title of
         the HTML report.

      -  ``TITLE``: the comment that is displayed in the title of the
         HTML report.

.. note::
   **Tip :** It is advised to set the format to ``noframes`` if your test
   suite is not a Java testsuite. If the format is set to ``frames``, with
   a non-Java MicroEJ Testsuite, the name of the links will not be
   relevant because of the non-existency of packages.


.. _testsuite-trace-analyzer:

Using the Trace Analyzer
------------------------

This section will shortly explains how to use the ``Trace Analyzer``.
The MicroEJ Testsuite comes with an archive containing the
``Trace Analyzer`` which can be used to analyze the output trace of an
application. It can be used from different forms;

-  The ``FileTraceAnalyzer`` will analyze a file and research for the
   given tags, failing if the success tag is not found.

-  The ``SerialTraceAnalyzer`` will analyze the data from a serial
   connection.

.. _testsuite-trace-analyzer-options:

The TraceAnalyzer Tasks Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the common options to all TraceAnalyzer tasks:

-  ``successTag``: the regular expression which is synonym of success
   when found (by default ``.*PASSED.*``).

-  ``failureTag``: the regular expression which is synonym of failure
   when found (by default ``.*FAILED.*``).

-  ``verboseLevel``: int value between 0 and 9 to define the verbose
   level.

-  ``waitingTimeAfterSuccess``: waiting time (in s) after success before
   closing the stream (by default 5).

-  ``noActivityTimeout``: timeout (in s) with no activity on the stream
   before closing the stream. Set it to 0 to disable timeout (default
   value is 0).

-  ``stopEOFReached``: boolean value. Set to ``true`` to stop analyzing
   when input stream EOF is reached. If ``false``, continue until
   timeout is reached (by default ``false``).

-  ``onlyPrintableCharacters``: boolean value. Set to ``true`` to only
   dump ASCII printable characters (by default ``false``).

.. _testsuite-trace-analyzer-file:

The FileTraceAnalyzer Task Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the specific options of the FileTraceAnalyzer task:

-  ``traceFile``: path to the file to analyze.

.. _testsuite-trace-analyzer-serial:

The SerialTraceAnalyzer Task Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the specific options of the SerialTraceAnalyzer task:

-  ``port``: the comm port to open.

-  ``baudrate``: serial baudrate (by default 9600).

-  ``databits``: databits (5|6|7|8) (by default 8).

-  ``stopBits``: stopbits (0|1|3 for (1_5)) (by default 1).

-  ``parity``: ``none`` \| ``odd`` \| ``event`` (by default ``none``).


.. _testsuite-various:

Appendix
--------

The goal of this section is to explain some tips and tricks that might
be useful in your usage of the testsuite engine.

.. _testsuite-various-customproperties:

Specific Custom Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some custom properties are specifics and retrieved from the testsuite
engine in the custom properties file of a test.

-  The ``testsuite.test.name`` property is the output name of the
   current test. Here are the steps to compute the output name of a
   test:

   -  If the custom properties are enabled and a property named
      ``testsuite.test.name`` is find on the corresponding file, then
      the output name of the current test will be set to it.

   -  Otherwise, if the running MicroEJ Testsuite is a Java testsuite,
      the output name is set to the class name of the test.

   -  Otherwise, from the path containing all the tests, a common prefix
      will be retrieved. The output name will be set to the relative
      path of the current test from this common prefix. If the common
      prefix equals the name of the test, then the output name will be
      set to the name of the test.

   -  Finally, if multiples tests have the same output name, then the
      current name will be followed by ``_XXX``, an underscore and an
      integer.

-  The ``testsuite.test.timeout`` property allow the user to redefine
   the time out for each test. If it is negative or not an integer, then
   global timeout defined for the MicroEJ Testsuite is used.
