Local Workspaces and Repositories
=================================

When starting MicroEJ SDK, it prompts you to select the last used
workspace or a default workspace on the first run. A workspace is a main
folder where to find a set of projects containing MicroEJ source code.

When loading a new workspace, MicroEJ SDK prompts for the location of
the MicroEJ repository, where the MicroEJ Architectures, Platforms or Virtual Devices will be imported. 
By default, MicroEJ SDK suggests to point to the default MicroEJ
repository on your operating system, located at
``${user.home}/.microej/repositories/[version]``. You can select an
alternative location. Another common practice is to define a local
repository relative to the workspace, so that the workspace is
self-contained, without external file system links and can be shared
within a zip file.
