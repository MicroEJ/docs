About MicroEJ
=============

MicroEJ's mission is to democratize virtualization and Object Oriented
Programming (OOP) to the embedded world. These two technologies,
widely used in computers and smartphones, radically simplifies how
device software is built, from prototyping to hardware choice, by
integrating simulation, systemic software reuse, modularity, agility,
continuous integration, automated testing and software component
update in the development process.

The virtualized environment provided by MICROEJ VEE on-device platform
allows for software development on virtual devices, exact “virtual
twins” of real electronic configurations. Since several configurations
can be tested and evaluated within days, it is therefore much easier
to build several prototypes while capitalizing on the code that has
already been built as “ready-to-use” binary software assets. 

MicroEJ also offers an integrated development environment, called
MICROEJ SDK, which provides one of the widest ranges of standard and
specialized tools and libraries, making it possible to easily develop
applications implementing IoT connectivity, graphical interfaces,
security, and real-time processing of data (Edge Computing).

Browse this documentation to discover MicroEJ technology, learn about
application and platform development, and begin your coding journey
thanks to a comprehensive range of dedicated tutorials.
