Getting Started
===============

MicroEJ provides a ready-to-use Kernel template called `Kernel GREEN` to get familiar with Kernel development.

This Kernel is used in two forms:

- in binary form: pre-built Executables and Virtual Devices for evaluation boards available at https://repository.microej.com/packages/green/.
  It allows the Application developer to write its first Sandboxed Application quickly and then dynamically deploy it through a TCP/IP connection. 
  See the `Get Started with Multi-Sandbox for STM32F7508-DK Discovery Kit <https://developer.microej.com/stm32f7508-dk-discovery-kit-get-started-multi-sandbox/>`_.

- in source form: the Kernel GREEN repository is available at https://github.com/MicroEJ/Kernel-GREEN.
  It allows the Kernel developer to explore Multi-Sandboxing capabilities and start to adapt them to its needs.
  See the `README <https://github.com/MicroEJ/Kernel-GREEN/blob/master/README.md>`_ file from the repository. 
  It contains a step-by-step guide to build the Kernel GREEN on any compatible VEE Port.
