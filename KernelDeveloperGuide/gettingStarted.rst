Online Getting Started
----------------------

To get familiar with Kernel developement, MicroEJ provides several way of evaluating Kernel capabilities.

As a first approach, MicroEJ does provide a Ready-to-use Multi-Sandbox evaluation Kernel called Kernel-GREEN on the STM32F7508-DK board available `here <https://developer.microej.com/stm32f7508-dk-discovery-kit-get-started-multi-sandbox/>`_.

This Getting Started allows an application developer to easily develop and deploy applications over a Multi-Sandbox executable.

As a Kernel Developper, MicroEJ also provides the GREEN Kernel sources in a GitHub repository available `here <https://github.com/MicroEJ/Kernel-GREEN>`_ allowing the user to update the Kernel itself to fit its needs.

The `README <https://github.com/MicroEJ/Kernel-GREEN/blob/master/README.md>`_ file from the repository contains a step by step guide to build the Kernel on an evaluation Device on which new applications can then be dynamically deployed through a TCP/IP connection.
