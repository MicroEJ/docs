Online Getting Started
----------------------

To get familiar with Kernel development, MicroEJ provides several ways of evaluating Kernel capabilities.

As a first approach, MicroEJ does provide a Ready-to-use Multi-Sandbox evaluation Kernel called Kernel-GREEN on the STM32F7508-DK board available on the `MicroEJ Developer Website `_.

This Getting Started allows an application developer to easily develop and deploy applications over a Multi-Sandbox executable.

As a Kernel Developer, MicroEJ also provides the GREEN Kernel sources in a `GitHub repository `_ allowing the user to update the Kernel itself to fit its needs.

The `README `_ file from the repository contains a step by step guide to build the Kernel on an evaluation Device on which new applications can then be dynamically deployed through a TCP/IP connection.
