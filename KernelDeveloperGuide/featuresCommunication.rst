Communication between Features
==============================

Features can communicate together through the use of shared interfaces.
The mechanism is described in *Chapter Shared Interfaces* of the
Application Developer's Guide.

Kernel Type Converters
----------------------

The shared interface mechanism allows to transfer an object instance of
a Kernel type from one Feature to an other. To do that, the Kernel must
register a new converter (See :ref:`kf.api.javadoc`
``Kernel.addConverter()`` method).

See also :ref:`available.kernel.converters` for a list of existing
converters.
