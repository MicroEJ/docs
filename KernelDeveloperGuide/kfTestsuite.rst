Setup a KF Test Suite
=====================

A KF test suite can be executed when building a Foundation Library or an Add-On library, 
and usually extends the tests written for the :ref:`default library test suite <application_testsuite>` to verify the behavior
of this library when its APIs are exposed by a Kernel.

A KF test suite is composed of a set of KF tests, each KF test itself is a minimal Multi-Sandbox Executable composed of a Kernel and zero or more Features.


Enable the Test Suite
---------------------

In an existing library project:

- Create the ``src/test/projects`` directory,
- Edit the ``module.ivy`` and insert the following line within the ``<ea:build>`` XML element:

  ::

    <ea:plugin organisation="com.is2t.easyant.plugins" module="microej-kf-testsuite" revision="+" />
- Configure the option ``artifacts.resolver`` to the name of the resolver used to import KF test dependencies.  
  The name must be one of the resolver names defined in your :ref:`settings file <mmm_settings_file>`. 
  If you are using the default settings file, set the option to ``MicroEJChainResolver``.
  This option is usually set as a global :ref:`MMM option <mmm_options>`.

Add a KF Test
-------------

A KF test is a structured directory placed in the ``src/test/projects`` directory.

- Create a new directory for the KF test
- Within this directory, create the sub-projects:
  
  - Create a new directory for the Kernel project and initialize it using the ``microej-javalib`` :ref:`skeleton <mmm_module_skeleton>`,
  - Create a new directory for the Feature project and initialize it using the ``application`` :ref:`skeleton <mmm_module_skeleton>`,
  - Create a new directory for the Firmware project and initialize it using the ``firmware-multiapp`` :ref:`skeleton <mmm_module_skeleton>`.

The names of the project directories are free, however MicroEJ suggests the following naming convention, assuming the KF test directory is ``[TestName]``:

- ``[TestName]-kernel`` for the Kernel project, 
- ``[TestName]-app[1..N]`` for Feature projects,
- ``[TestName]-firmware`` for the Firmware project. 

The KF Test Suite structure shall be similar to the following figure:

All the projects will be built automatically in the right order based on their dependencies.

KF Test Suite Options
---------------------
   
It is possible to configure the same options defined by :ref:`Test Suite Options <testsuite_options>` for the KF test suite, 
by using the prefix ``microej.kf.testsuite.properties`` instead of ``microej.testsuite.properties``.
