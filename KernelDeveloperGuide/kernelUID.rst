Kernel UID
==========

The Kernel UID is a sequence of bytes that uniquely identifies the Kernel.
This UID is generated by SOAR from Java code content, Platform characteristics and a timestamp.
Two Kernels built from the same Kernel Application code will not share the same UID.

The Kernel UID is used by :ref:`core_engine` to check if an Application can be installed on a Kernel.
During the :ref:`Application build <soar_build_phases>`, the resulting ``.fo`` file embeds the Kernel UID on which is has been built.

During `Kernel.install() <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/kf/Kernel.html#install-java.io.InputStream->`_, the UID embedded in the ``.fo`` is compared with the Kernel UID.
By default, if both UIDs are equal the Application installation continues. Otherwise it is stopped.
See also :ref:`feature_portability_control` for ``.fo`` installation on different Kernels.

The Kernel UID can be retrieved at runtime using `Kernel.getInstance() <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/kf/Kernel.html#getInstance-->`_ `.getUID() <https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/ej/kf/Module.html#getUID-->`_.
