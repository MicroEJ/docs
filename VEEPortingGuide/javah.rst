MicroEJ Java H
==============


Principle
=========

This MicroEJ tool is useful for creating the skeleton of a C file, to
which some Java native implementation functions will later be written.
This tool helps prevent misses of some ``#include`` files, and helps
ensure that function signatures are correct.


Functional Description
======================

MicroEJ Java H tool takes as input one or several Java class files 
(\*.class) from directories and / or JAR files. It looks for Java native
methods declared in these class files, and generates a skeleton(s) of
the C file(s).
