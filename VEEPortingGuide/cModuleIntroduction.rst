MicroEJ provides C modules to accelerate the creation and maintenance of VEE Ports.

The C modules related to foundation libraries or packs are called Abstraction Layers. Refer to the :ref:`pack_overview` documentation to get the list of available Abstraction Layers.

MicroEJ also provides C modules that do not depend on a pack or foundation library, which are listed in this section.
