Simulation
==========

Principle
=========

The VG Pack embeds an extension of :ref:`UI Pack's Front Panel mock <section_ui_simulation>` to implement the equivalent of the five embedded modules (Matrix, Path, Gradient, Image and Font).

The implementation simulates the same characteristics and limitations as the embedded modules. 

Installation
============

No action is required in the VEE Port's Front Panel project: the MicroVG simulation part is automatically used when an application uses MicroVG APIs on the simulator.

Use
===

Launch a MicroVG application on the Simulator to run the Front Panel extension.
