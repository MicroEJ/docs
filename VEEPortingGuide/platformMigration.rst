Former Platform Migration
=========================

This chapter describes the steps to migrate a former MicroEJ Platform in its latest form described in :ref:`new_platform_creation` chapter.

As a reminder, this new form brings two main features:

- Both Platform :ref:`build <platform_build>` and :ref:`dependencies declaration <platform_configuration_creation>` are managed by :ref:`mmm`. This allows a fully automated build and continuous integration.
- The configuration of the target Board Support Package (BSP) has been revisited to support any :ref:`BSP Connection cases <bsp_connection_cases>`.
 
Former MicroEJ Platforms were usually distributed by MicroEJ Corp. in an all-in-one ZIP file also called `fullPackaging`.

In this document, the `MicroEJ Platform for STMicroelectronics STM32F746G-DISCO board
<https://repository.microej.com/packages/referenceimplementations/846SI/3.4.2/STM32F746GDISCO-846SI-fullPackaging-eval-3.4.2.zip>`_
will be used as an example.

The following figure shows the `fullPackaging` structure once extracted.

   STM32F746G-DISCO Platform Full Packaging Structure 

The migration steps are:

#. Create a :ref:`Module Repository <module_repository>` to store the :ref:`MicroEJ Architecture <architecture_overview>`
   and :ref:`MicroEJ Packs <pack_overview>` used by the Platform.
#. Import the `Platform Configuration Additions <https://github.com/MicroEJ/VEEPortQualificationTools/blob/master/framework/platform/>`_ into the Platform
   Configuration project.
#. Update the Front Panel project configuration.
#. Configure the :ref:`BSP Connection <bsp_connection>`.
#. Add the :ref:`Build Script <bsp_connection_build_script>` and :ref:`Run Script <bsp_connection_run_script>`.

.. note::

   The migration of a Platform requires at least the version ``5.4.0`` of the SDK.

.. _platform_migration_repository:

Create an Architecture Repository
---------------------------------

The first step is to create an Architecture Repository containing the Architecture 
and Packs provided in the ``platformArchitecture`` directory of the `fullPackaging` package.

.. note:: If the Architecture and Packs used by the Platform are already stored in the 
  module repositories provided by MicroEJ Corp (:ref:`Central Repository <central_repository>`, :ref:`Developer Repository <developer_repository>`),
  or in your organization's repositories, then move to the next step.


By default, we provide the steps to extend the default :ref:`MicroEJ SDK settings file configuration <mmm_configuration>`
with local Architecture and Packs modules.
The following steps can be adapted to custom :ref:`settings file <mmm_settings_file>`.

- Create a new empty project named ``architecture-repository``
- Create a new file named ``ivysettings.xml`` with the following content and update the included settings file according to your MicroEJ SDK version (see :ref:`get_sdk_version`)
  
  .. code-block:: xml

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <ivysettings>
       <property name="local.repo.url" value="${ivy.settings.dir}" override="false"/>

       <!--
           Include default settings file for MicroEJ SDK version:
           - MICROEJ SDK 5.4.0 or higher: ${user.home}/.microej/microej-ivysettings-5.4.xml
           - MICROEJ SDK 5.0.0 to 5.3.1: ${user.home}/.microej/microej-ivysettings-5.xml
           - MICROEJ SDK 4.1.x: ${user.home}/.ivy2/microej-ivysettings-4.1.xml
       -->
       <include file="${user.home}/.microej/microej-ivysettings-5.xml"/>

       <settings defaultResolver="ArchitectureResolver"/>

       <resolvers>
         <chain name="ArchitectureResolver">
           <filesystem m2compatible="true">
             <artifact pattern="${local.repo.url}/${microej.artifact.pattern}" />
             <ivy pattern="${local.repo.url}/${microej.ivy.pattern}" />
           </filesystem>
           <resolver ref="${microej.default.resolver}"/>
         </chain>
       </resolvers>
     </ivysettings>

- Copy the Architecture file (``.xpf``) into the correct directory
  following its :ref:`naming convention <architecture_naming_convention>`).

  - Open or extract the Architecture file (``.xpf``)
  - Open the ``release.properties`` file to retrieve the naming convention mapping:

    - ``architecture`` is the ``ISA`` (e.g. ``CM7``)
    - ``toolchain`` is the ``TOOLCHAIN`` (e.g. ``CM7hardfp_ARMCC5``)
    - ``name`` is the ``UID`` (e.g. ``flopi7A21``)
    - ``version`` is the ``VERSION`` (e.g. ``7.11.0``)

  For example, in the STM32F746G-DISCO Platform, the Architecture file ``flopi7A21-eval.xpf`` 
  shall be copied and renamed to
  ``architecture-repository/com/microej/architecture/CM7/CM7hardfp_ARMCC5/flopi7A21/7.11.0/flopi7A21-7.11.0-eval.xpf``.

- Copy the Architecture Specific Packs files (``.xpfp``) into
  the correct directory following MicroEJ Naming Convention (see
  :ref:`pack_import`) with the exception of the Standalone pack that
  should not be imported (e.g. named ``flopi7A21Standalone.xpfp``).

  - Open or extract the Architecture Specific Pack (``.xpfp``).

    .. note:: The Architecture Specific Packs have the ``UID``
              of the Architecture in their name
              (e.g. ``flopi7A21UI.xpfp``) and their
              ``release_pack.properties`` file contains the
              information of the Architecture.

  - Open the ``release_pack.properties`` file to retrieve the naming convention mapping:

    - ``architecture`` is the ``ISA`` (e.g. ``CM7``)
    - ``toolchain`` is the ``TOOLCHAIN`` (e.g. ``CM7hardfp_ARMCC5``)
    - ``name`` is the ``UID`` (e.g. ``flopi7A21``)
    - ``packName`` is the ``NAME`` (e.g. ``ui``)
    - ``packVersion`` is the ``VERSION`` (e.g. ``12.0.1``)

  For example, in the STM32F746G-DISCO Platform, the Architecture Specific Pack UI ``flopi7A21UI.xpfp`` shall be copied
  and renamed to
  ``architecture-repository/com/microej/architecture/CM7/CM7hardfp_ARMCC5/flopi7A21-ui-pack/12.0.1/flopi7A21-ui-pack-12.0.1.xpfp``.

- Copy the Legacy Generic Packs (``.xpfp`` files) into the correct directory
  following MicroEJ Naming Convention (see :ref:`pack_import`).

  - Open or extract the Generic Pack (``.xpfp``).

    .. note:: The ``release_pack.properties`` of Legacy Generic Packs does not contain information about
                Architecture.

  - Open the ``release_pack.properties`` file:

    - ``packName`` is the ``NAME`` (e.g. ``fs``)
    - ``packVersion`` is the ``VERSION`` (e.g. ``4.0.2``)

  For example, in the STM32F746G-DISCO Platform, the Legacy Generic Pack FS ``fs.xpfp`` 
  shall be copied and renamed to
  ``architecture-repository/com/microej/pack/fs/4.0.2/fs-4.0.2.xpfp``.

- Configure MicroEJ Module Manager to use the Architecture Repository:

  - Go to :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Preferences` >
    :guilabel:`MicroEJ` > :guilabel:`Module Manager`
  - In :guilabel:`Module Repository` set :guilabel:`Settings File:` to
    ``${workspace_loc:architecture-repository/ivysettings.xml}``.
  - :guilabel:`Apply and Close`

Here is the layout of the Architecture Repository for the STM32F746G-DISCO Platform.

Import the Former Platform Sources
----------------------------------

- Go to :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`Import...` > 
  :guilabel:`General` > :guilabel:`Existing Projects into Workspace`.
- Browse to the archive file that contains the platform sources, like in the example below.

  .. figure:: images/platformMigration-import.png
     :align: center

- Select the ``-configuration``, ``-fp`` and ``-bsp`` projects prefixed with the Platform name (e.g., ``STM32F746GDISCO-Full-CM7_ARMCC-FreeRTOS``).
- Click ``Finish``.


Install the Platform Configuration Additions
--------------------------------------------

- Rename the file ``bsp.properties`` located in the Platform Configuration Project to ``bsp2.properties`` (save it
  for later).
- Install `Platform Configuration Additions <https://github.com/MicroEJ/VEEPortQualificationTools/blob/master/framework/platform/>`_, 
  by following instructions described at https://github.com/MicroEJ/VEEPortQualificationTools/blob/master/framework/platform/README.rst.
  Files within the ``content`` folder have to be copied to the ``-configuration`` project
  (e.g. ``STM32F746GDISCO-Full-CM7_ARMCC-FreeRTOS-configuration``).
- Edit the ``module.properties`` file and set
  ``com.microej.platformbuilder.platform.filename`` to the name of the
  platform configuration file (e.g. ``STM32F746GDISCO.platform``).
- Update the default name of the Platform module in the ``module.ivy``. Replace with ``<info organisation="com.microej.platform.st.stm32f746g-disco" module="Platform" status="integration" revision="1.0.0">``.
- Update the ``module.ivy`` with the Architecture and Packs dependencies.

Here is the module dependencies declared for the STM32F746G-DISCO Platform.

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: STM32F746GDISCO-Full-CM7_ARMCC-FreeRTOS-configuration/module.ivy

   <dependencies>
     <!-- MicroEJ Architecture -->
     <dependency org="com.microej.architecture.CM7.CM7hardfp_ARMCC5" name="flopi7A21" rev="7.11.0">

     <dependency org="com.microej.pack" name="hal" rev="2.0.1">
       <artifact name="hal" ext="xpfp"/>
     </dependency>
     
   </dependencies>
      

Update the Front Panel Configuration
------------------------------------

- In ``-configuration/frontpanel/frontpanel.properties`` set the
  ``project.name`` to the folder name that contains the front-panel
  (e.g. ``project.name=STM32F746GDISCO-Full-CM7_ARMCC-FreeRTOS-fp``).

At this state, the Platform is not connected to the BSP yet, but you
can check that everything is properly configured so far by building it:

- Right-click on the ``-configuration`` project and select
  :guilabel:`Build Module`
- Import the Platform built into the workspace by following the instructions available at the end of the build logs (see logs example below).

.. code-block::

  module-platform:report:
      [echo]     ============================================================================================================
      [echo]     Platform has been built in this directory 'C:\STM32F746GDISCO-Platform-CM7hardfp_ARMCC5-0.1.0'.
      [echo]     To import this project in your MicroEJ SDK workspace (if not already available):
      [echo]      - Select 'File' > 'Import...' > 'General' > 'Existing Projects into Workspace' > 'Next'
      [echo]      - Check 'Select root directory' and browse 'C:\STM32F746GDISCO-Platform-CM7hardfp_ARMCC5-0.1.0' > 'Finish'
      [echo]     ============================================================================================================

At this stage the Platform is built and imported in the workspace, so you can create a Standalone Application and run it on the
Simulator (see :ref:`simulator_execution`).

.. note:: 

  If the build failed, it might be because the Architecture and Packs can not be retrieved from the Architecture Repository.
  Ensure that the Architecture Repository is correctly configured and that it contains the required artifacts (as described in :ref:`the first step <platform_migration_repository>`).



Configure the BSP Connection
----------------------------

This section explains how to configure a full BSP Connection on the
STM32F746G-DISCO Platform.  See :ref:`bsp_connection` for more
information.

- Open ``-configuration/bsp/bsp.properties``.
- Comment out and set the following variables:

  - ``root.dir``
  - ``microejapp.relative.dir``
  - ``microejlib.relative.dir``
  - ``microejinc.relative.dir``
  - ``microejscript.relative.dir``

  For example:

  .. code-block:: properties

     # Specify the MicroEJ Application file ('microejapp.o') parent directory.
     # This is a '/' separated directory relative to 'bsp.root.dir'.
     microejapp.relative.dir=Projects/STM32746G-Discovery/Applications/MicroEJ/platform/lib
     
     # Specify the MicroEJ Platform runtime file ('microejruntime.a') parent directory.
     # This is a '/' separated directory relative to 'bsp.root.dir'.
     microejlib.relative.dir=Projects/STM32746G-Discovery/Applications/MicroEJ/platform/lib
     
     # Specify MicroEJ Platform header files ('*.h') parent directory.
     # This is a '/' separated directory relative to 'bsp.root.dir'.
     microejinc.relative.dir=Projects/STM32746G-Discovery/Applications/MicroEJ/platform/inc
     
     # Specify BSP external scripts files ('build.bat' and 'run.bat') parent directory.
     # This is a '/' separated directory relative to 'bsp.root.dir'.
     microejscript.relative.dir=Projects/STM32746G-Discovery/Applications/MicroEJ/scripts
     
     # Specify the BSP root directory. Can use ${project.parent.dir} which target the parent of platform configuration project
     # For example, '${project.parent.dir}/PROJECT-NAME-bsp' specifies a BSP project beside the '-configuration' project
     root.dir=${project.parent.dir}/STM32F746GDISCO-Full-CM7_ARMCC-FreeRTOS-bsp/

The paths to ``microejXXX.relative.dir`` can be inferred by looking at
the ``output.dir`` value in ``bsp2.properties`` saved earlier.  For
example on the STM32F746G-DISCO project, its value is
``${workspace}/${project.prefix}-bsp/Projects/STM32746G-Discovery/Applications/MicroEJ/platform``.

- The BSP project path ``${workspace}/${project.prefix}-bsp`` becomes
  ``${project.parent.dir}/STM32F746GDISCO-Full-CM7_ARMCC-FreeRTOS-bsp/``.
- ``Projects/STM32746G-Discovery/Applications/MicroEJ/platform`` is
  the path to the Application file, Platform header and
  runtime files.  MicroEJ convention is to put the Application
  file and Platform runtime files to ``platform/lib/`` and
  the Platform header files to ``platform/inc/``.
- :ref:`bsp_connection_build_script` and
  :ref:`bsp_connection_run_script` are PCA-specific and did not exist
  before.  By convention we put them in a ``scripts/`` directory.

The paths to ``microejXXX.relative.dir`` can be also be checked by
looking at the C TOOLCHAIN configuration of the BSP.  For example on
the STM32F746G-DISCO project, the BSP configuration is located at
``STM32F746GDISCO-Full-CM7_ARMCC-FreeRTOS-bsp/Projects/STM32746G-Discovery/Applications/MicroEJ/MDK-ARM/Project.uvprojx``.

- In :guilabel:`Project` > :guilabel:`Options for Target
  'standalone'...` > :guilabel:`C/C++` > :guilabel:`Include Paths`
  contains ``../platform/inc``.  This corresponds to the
  ``microejinc.relative.dir`` relative the TOOLCHAIN project's file.
- In the :guilabel:`Project` pane, there is a folder ``MicroEJ/Libs``
  that contains ``microejruntime.lib`` and ``microejapp.o``.

  - Right-click on ``microejruntime.lib`` > :guilabel:`Options for
    File 'XXX'...`.  The :guilabel:`Path` is
    ``../platform/lib/microejruntime.lib``.  This corresponds to the
    ``microejlib.relative.dir``.
  - Right-click on ``microejapp.o`` > :guilabel:`Options for File
    'XXX'...`.  The :guilabel:`Path` is
    ``../platform/lib/microejapp.o``.  This corresponds to the
    ``microejapp.relative.dir``.
- Rebuild the platform (Right-click on the ``-configuration`` project
  and select :guilabel:`Build Module`)
  
At this stage the Platform is connected to the BSP so you can 
build and program a Firmware (see :ref:`device_build`).

Add the Build and Run Scripts
-----------------------------

The final stage consists of adding the :ref:`Build Script <bsp_connection_build_script>`, 
to automate the build of a Firmware, and the :ref:`Run Script <bsp_connection_run_script>`, to automate the programming of a MicroEJ Firmware
onto the device.

The `Platform Qualification Tools`_ provides examples of Build Script
and Run Script for various C TOOLCHAIN `here
<https://github.com/MicroEJ/VEEPortQualificationTools/tree/master/framework/platform/scripts>`__. 
:ref:`This tutorial <tutorial_create_platform_build_and_run_scripts>` also describes the steps to create 
and use these scripts.

On the STM32F746G-DISCO, the C TOOLCHAIN used is Keil uVision.

- Create the directory pointed by ``microejscript.relative.dir``
  (e.g. ``STM32F746GDISCO-Full-CM7_ARMCC-FreeRTOS-bsp\Projects\STM32746G-Discovery\Applications\MicroEJ\scripts``).
- Copy the example scripts from the `Platform Qualification Tools`_
  for the C TOOLCHAIN of the BSP
  (e.g. ``PlatformQualificationTools/framework/platform/scripts/KEILuV5/``)
- Configure the scripts. Refer to the documentation in the scripts
  comments for this step.
- Enable the execution of the build script: 

  - Go to :guilabel:`Run` > :guilabel:`Run Configurations...`
  - Select the launch configuration
  - Go to :guilabel:`Configuration` > :guilabel:`Device` > :guilabel:`Deploy`
  - Ensure :guilabel:`Execute the MicroEJ build script (build.bat) at
    a location known by the 3rd-party BSP project.` is checked.



Use the Platform in Module Projects
-----------------------------------

Module projects may require the Platform, for example to build an Application or to run a Test Suite.
One way of selecting the Platform in a module project is to declare it as a module dependency (see :ref:`platform_selection`).

In case a former Platform is loaded this way in your existing module projects, the dependency has to be updated.
In this example, the Platform would now be selected like this:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <dependency org="com.microej.platform.st.stm32f746g-disco" name="Platform" rev="1.0.0" conf="platform->default" transitive="false"/>

This also requires that your module projects use a compatible version of the associated build type (the build type relates to the :ref:`module_natures`).
As stated before, loading a Platform in its latest form requires at least the version ``5.4.0`` of the SDK.
Therefore, make sure to use versions of the build types that come with the SDK ``5.4.0`` and above.
Here is a brief summary of the minimum version for the most common module natures:

- :ref:`module_natures.addon_lib`: build type ``com.is2t.easyant.buildtypes#build-microej-javalib`` version ``5.0.0`` and above.
- :ref:`module_natures.standalone_application`: build type ``com.is2t.easyant.buildtypes#build-firmware-singleapp`` version ``1.4.0`` and above.
- :ref:`module_natures.sandboxed_application`: build type ``com.is2t.easyant.buildtypes#build-application`` version ``8.0.0`` and above.


Going further
-------------

Now that the Platform is connected to the BSP it can leverage
the Java Test Suites provided by the `Platform Qualification Tools`_.
See :ref:`run_test_suite_on_device` documentation for a step by step
explanation on how to do so.
