Image Format
============

The Image Engine makes the distinction between:

* the `input format`: how the original image is encoded, 
* the `output format`: how the image is used by the platform and/or the Image Renderer,
* the `embedded format`: how the image is embedded by the application. 

The Image Engine manages several standard formats in input: PNG, JPEG, BMP, etc. In addition, an input format may be custom (platform dependant). It manages two formats in output: the MicroEJ format and the binary format. The Image Renderer manages only the MicroEJ format (:ref:`section_image_standard_raw`, :ref:`section_image_display_raw` and :ref:`section_image_gpu_raw`). The binary output format (:ref:`section_image_binary_raw`) is fully platform dependant and can be used to encode some images which are not usable by MicroUI standard API.

The output format is generated from the input format

* by using the off-board tool :ref:`section_image_generator` at application compile-time 
* or by using a :ref:`runtime decoder <image_runtime_decoder>` of the :ref:`section_image_loader` at application run-time.

The embedded format may be the one of the output formats or the :ref:`original input format <section_image_asis>`.

.. _section_image_standard_raw:

MicroEJ Format: Standard
========================

Several MicroEJ format encodings are available. Some encodings may be directly managed by the display driver. Refers to the platform specification to retrieve the list of better formats.

Advantages:

* The pixels layout and bits format are standard, so it is easy to manipulate these images on the C-side.
* Drawing an image is very fast when the display driver recognizes the format (with or without transparency).
* Supports or not the alpha encoding: select the better format according to the image to encode.

Disadvantages:

* No compression: the image size in bytes is proportional to the number of pixels, the transparency, and the number of bits-per-pixel. 
* Slower than ``display`` format when the display driver does not recognize the  format: a pixel conversion is required at runtime.

This format requires a small header (around 20 bytes) to store the image size (width, height), format, flags (is_transparent etc.), row stride etc. The required memory also depends on number of bits-per-pixels of MicroEJ format:

::

      required_memory = header + (image_width * image_height) * bpp / 8;

The pixels array is stored after the MicroEJ image file header. A padding between the header and the pixels array is added to force to start the pixels array at a memory address aligned on number of bits-per-pixels.

The pixels order in MicroEJ file follows this rule:

   ::

         pixel_offset = (pixel_Y * image_width + pixel_X) * bpp / 8;

.. _section_image_display_raw:

MicroEJ Format: Display
=======================

The display can hold a pixel encoding which is not standard (see :ref:`display_pixel_structure`). The MicroEJ format can be customized to encode the pixel in same encoding than display. The number of bits-per-pixels and the pixel bits organisation is asked during the MicroEJ format generation and when the ``drawImage`` algorithms are running. If the image to encode contains some transparent pixels, the output file will embed the transparency according to the displayâ€™s implementation capacity. When all pixels are fully opaque, no extra information will be stored in the output file in order to free up some memory space.

.. note:: From Image Engine point of view, the format stays a MicroEJ format, readable by the Image Renderer.

Advantages:

* Encoding is identical to display encoding.
* Drawing an image is often very fast (simple memory copy when the display pixel encoding does not hold the opacity level).

Disadvantages:

* No compression: the image size in bytes is proportional to the number of pixels. The required memory is similar to :ref:`section_image_standard_raw`.

.. _section_image_gpu_raw:

MicroEJ Format: GPU
===================

The MicroEJ format may be customized to be platform's GPU compatible. It can be extanded by one or several restrictions on the pixels array: 

* Its start address has to be aligned on a higher value than the number of bits-per-pixels. 
* A padding has to be added after each line (row stride).
* The MicroEJ format can hold a platform dependant header, located between MicroEJ format header (start of file) and pixels array. The MicroEJ format is designed to let the platform encodes and decodes this additional header. For Image Engine software algorithms, this header is useless and never used. 

.. note:: From Image Engine point of view, the format stays a MicroEJ format, readable by the Image Engine Renderer.

Advantages:

* Encoding is recognized by the GPU.
* Drawing an image is often very fast.
* Supports opacity encoding.

Disadvantages:

* No compression: the image size in bytes is proportional to the number of pixels. The required memory is similar to :ref:`section_image_standard_raw` when there is no custom header. 

When MicroEJ format holds another header (called ``custom_header``), the required memory depends is:

::

      required_memory = header + custom_header + (image_width * image_height) * bpp / 8;

The row stride allows to add some padding at the end of each line in order to start next line at an address with a specific memory alignment; it is often required by hardware accelerators (GPU). The row stride is by default a value in relation with the image width: ``row_stride_in_bytes = image_width * bpp / 8``. It can be customized at image buffer creation thanks to the Low Level API ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_getNewImageStrideInBytes``.  The required RAM memory becomes:

::

      required_memory = header + custom_header + row_stride * image_height;

   :width: 50.0%

MicroEJ Format: RLE1
====================

The Image Engine can display embedded images that are encoded into a compressed format which encodes several consecutive pixels into one or more 16-bit words. This encoding only manages fully opaque and fully transparent pixels.

-  Several consecutive pixels have the same color (2 words).

   -  First 16-bit word specifies how many consecutive pixels have the
      same color (pixels colors converted in RGB565 format, without opacity data).

   -  Second 16-bit word is the pixels' color in RGB565 format.

-  Several consecutive pixels have their own color Â (1 + n words).

   -  First 16-bit word specifies how many consecutive pixels have their
      own color.

   -  Next 16-bit word is the next pixel color.

-  Several consecutive pixels are transparent (1 word).

   -  16-bit word specifies how many consecutive pixels are transparent.
   - Not designed for images with many different pixel colors: in such case, the output file size may be larger than the original image file.

Advantages:

* Supports fully opaque and fully transparent encoding.
* Good compression when several consecutive pixels respect one of the three previous rules.

Disadvantages:

* Drawing an image is slightly slower than when using Display format.

The file format is quite similar to :ref:`section_image_standard_raw`.

.. _section_image_binary_raw:

Binary Format
=============

This format is not compatible with the Image Renderer and by MicroUI. It is can be used by MicroUI addon libraries which provide their own images managements. 

Advantages:

* Encoding is known by platform.
* Compression is inherent to the format itself.

Disadvantages:

* This format cannot be used to target a MicroUI Image (unsupported format).

.. _section_image_asis:

Original Input Format
=====================

An image can be embedded without any conversion / compression. This allows to embed the resource as it is, in order to keep the source image characteristics (compression, bpp, etc.). This option produces the same result as specifying an image as a resource in the MicroEJ launcher.

Advantages:

* Conserves the image characteristics.

Disadvantages:

* Requires an image :ref:`runtime decoder <image_runtime_decoder>`.
* Requires some RAM in which to store the decoded image in MicroEJ format.

The following table lists the original formats that can be decoded at run-time and / or compile-time:

* Image Generator: the off-board tool that converts an image in an output format. All AWT `ImageIO`_ default formats are supported and always enabled.
* Front Panel: the decoders embedded by the simulator part. All AWT `ImageIO`_ default formats are supported but disabled by default.
* Runtime Decoders: the decoders embedded by the embedded part.
