BSP Port
========

Principle
=========

The BSP Port (or Embedded Port) involves implementing some Abstraction Layer APIs (low-level APIs: LLAPI).
There are several kinds of LLAPI:

- The mandatory LLAPI to manipulate the LEDs,
- The mandatory LLAPI to send the input events,
- The mandatory LLAPI to initialize, use and flush the drawings to the display,
- The optional LLAPI to customize the Graphics Engine to be compatible with the display constraints,
- The optional LLAPI to manipulate the optional display features (backlight, contrast, etc.),
- The optional LLAPI to add some features as new image decoders,
- The optional LLAPI to use a GPU.

The following chapters describe each group of Abstraction Layer APIs, except the GPU acceleration (see the dedicated section :ref:`ui_port_gpu`).

MicroUI C Module
================

The UI Pack **requires** the :ref:`MicroUI C module <section_ui_cco>`.
This C module 

- implements some MicroUI native functions,
- manages the drawings synchronization with the Graphics Engine,
- features an image heap allocator,
- features an input events decoder.

Before all, install the MicroUI C Module:

1. Find the correct version of the C module according to the UI Pack version; see :ref:`section_ui_releasenotes_cmodule`.
2. Unzip it in the BSP project.
3. Add the mandatory files to the list of the BSP project's compiled files: ``ui_image_drawing.c``, ``ui_drawing.c``, ``ui_rect_util.c``, ``LLUI_PAINTER_impl.c``, ``ui_display_brs_single.c``, ``LLDW_PAINTER_impl.c``, ``ui_display_brs.c``, ``ui_drawing_stub.c``, ``ui_display_brs_legacy.c`` and ``ui_display_brs_predraw.c``.
4. Add the optional files in the BSP project (if their associated feature is used/needed): 
 
   - ``LLUI_DISPLAY_HEAP_impl.c``: to use another image heap allocator,
   - ``LLUI_INPUT_LOG_impl.c`` and ``microui_event_decoder.c``: to decode the MicroUI event (input events and MicroUI internal events).

5. Add the C Module's include folder to the BSP project's include directories list.

LEDs
====

As soon as the VEE Port Configuration project LEDs module is checked, the VEE Port features the header file LLAPI ``LLUI_LED_impl.h``.
This header must be implemented.
The mandatory functions to implement are:

- ``LLUI_LED_IMPL_initialize``: initialize the LED driver (if required) and return the available number of LEDs.
- ``LLUI_LED_IMPL_getIntensity``: return, if possible, the LED intensity.
- ``LLUI_LED_IMPL_setIntensity``: set the LED intensity.

Refer to :ref:`section_leds_llapi` to have more information.
Refer too to the C-doc in the header file itself.

Inputs
======

The VEE Port always features the header file LLAPI  ``LLUI_INPUT_impl.h``.
This header must be implemented even if there is no input device: the critical section management is required by the MicroUI library itself.
The mandatory functions to implement are:

- ``LLUI_INPUT_IMPL_initialize``: can be empty if nothing is to initialize.
- ``LLUI_INPUT_IMPL_getInitialStateValue``: empty if there is no State Event Generator.
- ``LLUI_INPUT_IMPL_enterCriticalSection``: disable all input events (disable input devices interrupts and/or disable the OS scheduling).
- ``LLUI_INPUT_IMPL_leaveCriticalSection``: re-enable all inputs events.

Refer to :ref:`section_input_llapi` to have more information.
Refer too to the C-doc in the header file itself.

Display
=======

As soon as the VEE Port Configuration project Display module is checked, the VEE Port features the header file LLAPI ``LLUI_DISPLAY_impl.h``.
This header must be implemented.
The mandatory functions to implement are:

- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_initialize``: fill the given structure ``LLUI_DISPLAY_SInitData`` (display size, buffer address, etc.).
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_binarySemaphoreTake``: *takes* the given semaphore.
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_binarySemaphoreGive``: *gives* the given semaphore.
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_flush``: copy/transmit the buffer content to the LCD.

Refer to :ref:`section_display_llapi` to have more information.
Refer to the C-doc in the header file itself too.

Display: LCD Constraints
========================

According to the LCD constraints (see :ref:`ui_port_conf`), some additional LLAPI must be implemented:

- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_convertARGBColorToDisplayColor`` and ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_convertDisplayColorToARGBColor``: required when the pixel format is custom (not standard, see :ref:`section_display_implementation`).
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_prepareBlendingOfIndexedColors``: required when the display back buffer is a LUT buffer, not a pixel buffer.
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_isDoubleBuffered``: the default implementation returns always ``true``; only useful as information for the application.
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_isColor``: the default implementation always returns ``true`` when the BPP is higher than 8; only useful as information for the application.
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_getNumberOfColors``: the default implementation returns always ``1 << BPP``; only useful as information for the application.

Display: Buffer Configuration
=============================

This configuration consists in declaring the available number of buffers where MicroUI can draw (back buffer) and the strategy to apply to update these buffers after a flush.
Read and update the configuration file ``ui_display_brs_configuration.h``; more details in the chapter :ref:`section_display`.

Display: Optional Features
==========================

Several kinds of features can be implemented.

**Hardware features:**

- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_setContrast`` and ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_getContrast``: to configure the display contrast.
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_hasBacklight``, ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_setBacklight`` and ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_getBacklight``: to turn on or off the display backlight.

**Runtime Image Decoders**

The BSP can add some runtime image decoders with the runtime decoders selected in the VEE Port configuration project (modules PNG and BMP Monochrom decoders).

- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_decodeImage``: called by MicroUI to decode an image whose format is unknown by the internal runtime image decoders.

**Image Heap Management**

By default, a best-fit allocator manages the image heap.
To add another allocator, implement these functions:

- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_imageHeapInitialize``: initialize the allocator.
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_imageHeapAllocate``: allocates the expected buffer.
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_imageHeapFree``: frees the given buffer.

**MicroUI Image Management**

These three functions are only helpful for compatibility with a GPU; see :ref:`ui_port_gpu`.

- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_getNewImageStrideInBytes``
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_adjustNewImageCharacteristics``
- ``LLUI_DISPLAY_IMPL_initializeNewImage``

.. _ui_port_bsp_testsuite:

Test Suite
==========

The Port Qualification Toolkit (PQT) provides a UI test suite to validate the UI Port (see :ref:`vee_port_testsuite` to have more information).
This test suite **must** be executed to validate the UI Port and after each modification on this UI Port (for instance, after changes to improve performances).

The UI Port test suite is available here: 

- SDK 5: https://github.com/MicroEJ/VEEPortQualificationTools/tree/master/tests/ui/ui3
- SDK 6: https://github.com/MicroEJ/Tool-Project-Template-VEEPort/tree/master/vee-port/validation/ui

The test suite is constituted of two blocks:

- The minimal *Display* test suite: a simple application test (with source code) to validate the mandatory functions to implement to target a Display.
- An extended *Display* test suite: a library that tests several MicroUI drawings. This test suite only applies when the BSP uses a GPU to perform the drawings. See :ref:`ui_port_gpu`.

The test suite does not check all UI Port features.
However, some example projects are available in MicroEJ GitHub:

- LED: refer to the application https://github.com/MicroEJ/Example-Standalone-Foundation-Libraries/tree/master/microui.led.
- Input: refer to the application https://github.com/MicroEJ/Example-Standalone-Foundation-Libraries/tree/master/microui.input

Some other example projects are also available in MicroEJ GitHub and can be used to check if the UI Port is valid:

- Hello World: https://github.com/MicroEJ/Example-Standalone-Foundation-Libraries/tree/master/microui.helloworld
- Use of images: https://github.com/MicroEJ/Example-Standalone-Foundation-Libraries/tree/master/microui.image
