.. _changelog-8.0.0:

[8.0.0] - 2023-MM-DD
--------------------

This major Architecture version update introduces the following main features:

- Added compatibility with dynamic linkers enabling Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
- Added :ref:`Feature build on device <build_feature_on_device>`. For that, the SOAR has been deeply redesigned and split into multiple phases.
  The most noticeable change is about the :ref:`SOAR Information File <soar_info_file>` that is now composed of 3 files.
- Added Feature portability. The same ``.fo`` file can now be installed:    
  
  - On any Executable built from the same Kernel Application (``microejapp.o``). 
    The VEE Port C code can be modified and relinked without requiring to rebuild the ``.fo`` file anymore.
  
  - On different Kernel Applications provided some conditions are met. 
    Basically, a ``.fo`` built on Kernel 1 can be installed on Kernel 2 if the exposed Kernel APIs are left unchanged.
    See :ref:`feature_portability_control` for more details.
- Redesigned :ref:`Feature installation <feature_memory_installation>` flow. A Feature can now be installed in any byte-addressable memory, including ROM.
  Former Feature installation in RAM is preserved and is now called :ref:`In-Place Installation <feature_inplace_installation>`. 
  For that, ``LLKERNEL`` Low Level APIs have been fully rewritten.

If you plan to migrate a VEE Port from Architecture ``7.x`` to Architecture ``8.x``, consider the :ref:`architecture7_migration` chapter.

Core Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added option :ref:`com.microej.runtime.kernel.dynamicfeatures.max <option_maximum_number_of_dynamic_features>` to configure the maximum number of Features that can be dynamically installed.
- Renamed :ref:`Core Engine sections <core_engine_link>` to fully respect the ELF standard naming convention. 
- Removed check when passing a non-immortal array in SNI if VEE Port option ``core.sni.nonimmortal.access`` was set to ``false``.
- Removed ``LLBSP_isInReadOnlyMemory`` in Core Engine Abstraction Layer (``LLBSP.h`` file).
- Clarified ``LLMJVM_IMPL_getCurrentTime`` API contract in Core Engine Abstraction Layer (``LLMJVM_impl.h`` file).
- Fixed potential crash when Core Engine is restarted after a call to `System.exit(int)`_.
- Updated ``Trace`` C library from version ``1.0.0`` to ``2.0.0``:

  - Renamed header file ``trace.h`` into ``LLTRACE.h`` to avoid filename conflicts.
  
  - Renamed C functions ``TRACE_xxx`` into ``LLTRACE_xxx``.


Foundation Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Updated ``KF`` to version ``1.7``:
  
   -  Added heap memory control (`Kernel.setReservedMemory()`_ and `Feature.setMemoryLimit()`_ methods).
   -  Added load of a Feature resource (`Feature.getResourceAsStream()`_ method).

- Updated ``KF`` dynamic loader to support :ref:`Feature Custom Installation <feature_custom_installation>` mode.
- Removed Foundation Libraries API Jars and Javadoc.
- Fixed :ref:`option_embed_utf8` defaults to ``true`` when building a Standalone Application using MMM.
- Removed `Unknown product - Unknown version` comment in auto-generated Low Level API header files.
- Removed the ``Serial Communication`` modules group, including the Foundation Libraries ``ECOM`` and ``ECOM-COMM``. See :ref:`architecture7_migration_ecom`.
- Removed the deprecated ``Device Information`` module group, including the Foundation Library ``Device``. See :ref:`architecture7_migration_device`.
- [Single] Fixed an unexpected ``FeatureFinalizer`` exception when a Standalone Application touches a ``KF`` API.

[7.11.0] - 2019-06-24
---------------------

Important Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Java assertions execution is now disabled by default. If you
   experience any runtime trouble when migrating from a previous
   Architecture, please enable Java assertions execution both on
   Simulator and on Device (maybe the application code requires Java
   assertions to be executed).
-  Calls to Security Manager are now disabled by default. If you are
   using the Security Manager, it must be explicitly enabled using the
   option described below (likely the case when building a Multi-Sandbox
   Firmware and its associated Virtual Device).
-  Front Panel framework is now provided by the Architecture instead of
   the UI Pack. This allow to build a VEE Port with a Front Panel
   (splash screen, basic I/O, …), even if it does not provide a MicroUI
   port. Moreover, the Front Panel framework API has been redesigned and
   is now distributed using the ``ej.tool.frontpanel.framework`` module
   instead of the legacy Eclipse classpath variable.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- SOAR ``Internal SOAR error`` or  ``Stacks merging coherence error`` thrown when an ``if`` statement (being removed)
  is declared at the end of a ``try`` block:
  
  .. code-block:: java
      
      try {
         ...
         if (Constants.getBoolean(XXX)) { // constant resolved to false
            ... // code being removed
         }
      } catch (Exception e) {

   -  *WARNING: Current limitation: the ``if`` statement cannot wrap or
      be nested in a ``try-catch-finally`` statement*

-  Added an option for grouping all the methods by type in a single ELF
   section

   -  ``com.microej.soar.groupMethodsByType.enabled`` (``false`` by
      default)
   -  *WARNING: this option avoids to reach the maximum number of ELF

   to be more flexible depending on the C project layout. This also
   allows to deploy to the same C project different Applications built
   with different VEE Ports

   -  VEE Port configuration: in ``bsp/bsp.properties``, a new option
      ``output.dir`` indicates where the files are deployed by default

      -  Application (``microejapp.o``) and Runtime library
         (``microejruntime.a``) are deployed to ``${output.dir}/lib``.
         Architecture header files (``*.h``) are deployed to
         ``${output.dir}/inc/``
      -  When this option is not set, the legacy behavior is left
         unchanged (``project.file`` option in collaboration with
         ``augmentCProject`` scripts)

-  Fixed wrong ELF file generation when a section included in a LOAD
   segment was generated before one of the sections included in a LOAD
   segment declared before the first one (integrated in ELF Utils and
   Firmware Linker)
-  Fixed wrong ELF file generation when a section included in a LOAD
   segment had an address which was outside its LOAD segment virtual
   address space (integrated in ELF Utils and Firmware Linker)

.. _java.lang.IllegalStateException: https://repository.microej.com/javadoc/microej_5.x/apis/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html

.. _foundation-libraries-5:

Foundation Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Updated ``KF`` library in sync with Core Engine Kill related fixes
   and Simulator with Kernel & Features semantic
-  Updated ``BON`` library on Simulator (now uses the same
   implementation than the one used by the Core Engine)

.. _integration-4:

Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Added generation of ``architecture.properties`` file when building a
   VEE Port. (Used by SDK ``5.x`` when manipulating
   VEE Ports & Virtual Devices)

.. _simulator-5:

Simulator
~~~~~~~~~

-  Added ``Embed all types names`` option for Simulation
-  Added memory size simulation for Java Heap and Immortal Heap
   (Enabling ``Use target characteristics`` option is no more required)
-  Added Kernel & Features semantic, as defined in the ``KF-1.4``
   specification

   -  Fully implemented:

      -  Ownership for types, object and thread execution context
      -  Kernel mode
      -  Context Local Static Field References

   -  Partially implemented:

      -  Kernel API (Type grained only)
      -  Shared Interfaces are binded using direct reference links (no
         Proxy execution)
      -  `Feature.stop()`_ does not perform the safe kill. The
         application cannot be stopped unless it has correctly removed
         all its shared references.

   -  Not implemented:

      -  Dynamic Feature installation from
         `Kernel.install(java.io.InputStream)`_
      -  Execution Rules Runtime checks

-  Fixed Simulator COM port mapping default value (set to ``disabled``
   instead of ``UART<->UART`` in order to avoid an error when launch
   configuration is just created)
