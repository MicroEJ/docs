Introduction
============

A MicroEJ Architecture is a software package that includes the MicroEJ Runtime port to a specific target Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and C compiler.
It contains a set of libraries, tools and C header files. The MicroEJ Architectures are provided by MICROEJ SDK.

A VEE Port is a MicroEJ Architecture port for a custom device.

It relies on C drivers (aka low level LL drivers) for each VEE Port feature.
These drivers are implemented in the VEE Pot BSP project. This project is edited in the C compiler IDE/dev environment (e.g. KEIL, GCC, IAR).
E.g. the MicroUI library LED feature will require a ``LLUI_LED.c`` that implements the native on/off IO drive.

Each VEE Port is specific to:

* a MicroEJ Architecture (MCU ISA and C compiler)
* an optional RTOS (e.g. FreeRTOS - note: the MicroEJ Runtime can run bare metal)
* a device: the OS bring up code that is device specific (e.g. the MCU specific code/IO/RAM/Clock/Middlewareâ€¦ configurations)

MicroEJ Corp. provides MicroEJ Evaluation Architectures at https://repository.microej.com/modules/com/microej/architecture,
and `VEE Port Examples`_ for various evaluation boards.

The VEE Porting Guide explains how the core features are
accessed, configured and used for creating a port of MICROEJ VEE (VEE Port) on your dedicated device. 
It also explains how an Application can interoperate with native code, and
the details of the Architecture modules, including their APIs, error codes
and options. 

Semantics of implemented Foundation Libraries are described in
their respective chapters as well as the required Abstraction Layers APIs for porting them 
to different targets.

VEE Port Build Process
======================

The following figure shows the overall process to obtain an Executable file to deploy on a device.
The first three steps are performed within MICROEJ SDK. The remaining steps are performed within the C IDE.

   Overall Build Process

The steps are as follow:

1. Create a new VEE Port configuration project. This project
   describes the VEE Port to build (Architecture selection).

2. Select which modules provided by the Architecture and Packs will be
   installed in the VEE Port.

3. Build the VEE Port according to the choices made in steps 1 and 2.

4. Build an Application against the VEE Port in order
   to obtain an object file to link in the BSP.

5. Compile the BSP and link it with the Application object file that was
   built previously in step 4 to produce an Executable.

6. Final step: Deploy the Executable (i.e. the binary application) onto a device.

Create a VEE Port for a Custom Device
=====================================

VEE Port creation can be either done from scratch or modifying an existing VEE Port example project.
The following chart provides a handy guide to ease decision:

      :align: center

Before going on, make sure that the new device hardware is validated and at least a trace output is available.
It is also a good idea to run basic hardware tests like:

* Internal and external flash programming and verification
* RAM 8/16/32 -bit read/write operations (internal and external if any)
* EEMBC Coremark benchmark to verify the CPU/buses/memory/compiler configuration

A VEE Port Example is already available for the same MCU/RTOS/C Compiler
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the fastest way: `VEE Port Examples`_ are usually provided for a silicon vendor evaluation board.
Import this VEE Port in MICROEJ SDK.

As the MCU, RTOS and compiler are the same, only the device specific code needs to be changed (external RAM, external oscillator, communication interfaces).

VEE Port Configuration
::::::::::::::::::::::

* Modify the ``xxx-configuration`` project to match the device features and its associated configuration (e.g. GUI, Networking, ...).

Refer to MICROEJ SDK5 :ref:`platform_module_configuration` or MICROEJ SDK 6 VEE Porting Guide to learn more about VEE Port configuration.

More details on available modules can be found in the :ref:`vee-porting-guide`.

BSP
:::

Required actions:

* modify the BSP C project to match the device specification:

  * edit the scatter file/link options
  * edit the compilation options

* create/review/change the platform Low Level C drivers. 
  They must match the device components and the MCU IO pin assignment:
  
  .. note::
    
    A number of ``LL*.h`` files are referenced from the project. 
    Implement the function prototypes declared there so that the JVM can delegate the relevant operations to the provided BSP C functions.

Simulator
:::::::::

In the SDK:

* modify the existing Simulator Front Panel ``xxx-fp`` project

A VEE Port Example is not available for the same MCU/RTOS/C Compiler
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Look for an available `VEE Port Example <VEE Port Examples>`_ that will match in order of priority:

* same MCU part number.
* same RTOS.
* same C compiler.

At this point, consider either to modify the closest VEE Port:

* In the SDK: modify the VEE Port configuration.
* in the C IDE: start from an empty project that match with the MCU.

Or to start from scratch a new VEE Port:

* In the SDK: create the VEE Port and refer to the selected VEE Port as a model for implementation
  (refer to MICROEJ SDK5 :ref:`platform_configuration_creation` or MICROEJ SDK6 VEE Porting Guide)
* in the C IDE: start from an empty project and implement the drivers of each of the LL drivers API. 
  
  Make sure to link with:

  * the ``microejruntime.a`` that runs the JVM for the MCU Architecture
  * the ``microejapp.o`` that contains the compiled Java application

MCU
:::

The MCU specific code can be found:

* in the C project IDE properties
* in the linker file
* the IO configuration
* in the low level driver (these drivers are usually provided by the silicon vendor)

RTOS
::::

The LL driver is named ``LLMJVM_[RTOS].c/.h``. Modify this file to match the selected RTOS.

C Compiler
::::::::::

The BSP project is provided for a specific compiler (that matches the selected platform architecture).
Start a new project with the compiler IDE that includes the LL drivers and start the VEE Port in the ``main()`` function.

Platform Validation
-------------------

Refer to :ref:`veeport_qualification` to qualify the VEE Port.
