GNSS

Principle
=========

The GNSS module defines a low-level GNSS framework for embedded
devices. It allows you to manage the underlying GNSS engine and retrieve data such as the longitude, latitude, velocity and time.


Functional Description
======================

The MicroEJ Application manages the GNSS engine using
GnssManager abstraction. The GNSS implementation made for each MicroEJ
Platform is responsible for surfacing the native File System specific
behavior.

GNSS Mock
=========

GNSS values on simulator can be control through an UI that could be activated and deactivated with the property : ``com.is2t.gnss.embedded.mock.ui``.

Dependencies
============

-  ``LLGNSS_impl.h`` implementations (see
   :ref:`LLGNSS-API-SECTION`).


Installation
============

The GNSS :ref:`Pack <pack_overview>` module must be installed in your VEE Port.

In the Platform configuration project, (``-configuration`` suffix), add
the following dependency to the :ref:`module.ivy <mmm_module_description>` file:

::

	<dependency org="com.microej.pack.gnss" name="gnss-pack" rev="2.0.0" />

The Platform project must be rebuilt (:ref:`platform_build`).

Use
===

The `GNSS API Module`_ must be added to the :ref:`module.ivy <mmm_module_description>` of the MicroEJ 
Application project to use the GNSS library.
