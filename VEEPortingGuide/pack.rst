On top of a MicroEJ Architecture can be imported MicroEJ Packs which provide additional features such as:

-  :ref:`Serial Communications <pack_ecom_comm>`,
-  :ref:`Graphical User Interface <pack_gui>`,
-  :ref:`Networking <pack_net>`,
-  :ref:`Bluetooth <pack_bluetooth>`,
-  :ref:`Audio <pack_audio>`,
-  :ref:`File System <pack_fs>`,
-  etc.

Each MicroEJ Pack is optional and can be selected on demand in the VEE Port configuration.
