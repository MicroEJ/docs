Overview
========

The Android Compatibility Kit is composed of two main components:

* A runtime: applications developed on MicroEJ can run on the Android platform thanks to the Android-based implementation of the MicroEJ Foundation libraries and dedicated support libraries.
* A developer kit: the MICROEJ SDK 6 and a Gradle plugin provide the necessary support for developing applications in Android Studio using Gradle.

Workflow
--------

Below is a general overview of the workflow when developing a product that targets both MicroEJ and Android-powered devices.

Software Architecture
---------------------

Applications designed to run in MicroEJ VEE can also run on Android, thanks to a specific implementation of MicroEJ Foundation libraries based on Android libraries.
