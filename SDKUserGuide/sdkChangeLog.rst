-  See :ref:`SDK 5.4.0 Known Issues <known-issues-5.4.0>` section

[20.12] - 2020-12-11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Included :ref:`SDK 5.3.1 <changelog-5.3.1>`
-  Disabled Java version check when updating SDK (see
   :ref:`known issues of SDK Distribution 20.10 <known-issues-20.10>`)

[20.10] - 2020-10-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Included :ref:`SDK 5.3.0 <changelog-5.3.0>`
-  Updated to Eclipse version ``2020-06``
-  Fixed low quality MacOS SDK icons

**NOTE:** Starting with this release, only 64bits JRE are supported
because 32bits JRE support has been removed since Eclipse version
``2018-12``. See `this
link <https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.10/platform.php#java32-removal>`__
for more details.

.. _known-issues-20.10:

**KNOWN ISSUES**:

-  Projects configured with Null Analysis must be updated to import `EDC
   API 1.3.3 <https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/edc/1.3.3/>`__
   or higher in order to avoid an Eclipse JDT builder error (see also
   `this link <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566599>`__
   for more details).
-  The default settings file for connecting MicroEJ Central Repository
   is not automatically installed. To connect to the MicroEJ Central
   Repository, follow the procedure:

   -  For Windows, create the folder: ``C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.microej``.
   -  For Linux, create the folder: ``/home/$USER/.microej``.
   -  For macos, create the folder: ``/Users/$USER/.microej``.
   -  Download and save this file `microej-ivysettings-5.xml <https://repository.microej.com/microej-ivysettings-5.xml>`__ to the previously created ``.microej`` folder.
-  By default, a check is done on the JRE version required by the
   plugins on install/update. Since CDT requires JRE 11, it prevents to
   install/update a newer SDK version. The CDT documentation
   explains that this can be bypassed by disabling the option
   :guilabel:`Windows` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`Install/Update` > :guilabel:`Verify provisioning operation is compatible with currently running JRE`.

[20.07] - 2020-07-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Included :ref:`MicroEJ SDK 5.2.0 <changelog-5.2.0>`
-  Updated the default microej repository folder name (replaced
   SDK version by the distribution number)
-  Added ``Dist.`` prefix in installer name (e.g.
   ``MicroEJ SDK Dist. 20.07``) to avoid confusion between SDK
   distribution vs SDK version
-  Updated SDK End User License Agreement
-  Disabled popup window when installing a SDK update site
   (allow to install unsigned content by default)

[19.05] - 2019-05-17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Included :ref:`SDK version 5.1.0 <changelog-5.1.0>`
-  Updated MicroEJ icons (``16x16`` and ``32x32``)
-  Updated the publisher of Windows executables (``MicroEJ`` instead of
   ``IS2T SA.``)
-  Updated the JRE link to download in case the default JRE is not
   compatible. (``https://www.java.com`` is deprecated)

[19.02] - 2019-02-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Updated to Eclipse Oxygen version ``4.7.2``
-  Included :ref:`SDK version 5.0.1 <changelog-5.0.1>`
-  Included Sonarlint version ``4.0.0``

-  Some older build types versions have been removed by error.
   Consequently, using SDK ``5.4.0``, it may be not possible to
   build modules that have been created with an older SDK

-  Fixed slow Add-on Processor generation. The classpath
   passed to ADP modules could contain the same entry multiple times,
   which leads each ADP module to process the same classpath multiple
   times.
-  Fixed misspelled recommendation message when a build
   failed
-  Fixed ``Update Module Dependencies...`` tool: wrong
   ``ej:match="perfect"`` added where it was expected to be
   ``compatible``
-  Fixed ``Update Module Dependencies...`` tool: parse
   error when ``module.ivy``\ contains ``<artifact type="rip"/>``
   element
-  Fixed resolution and publication of a module declared
   with an Ivy branch
-  Fixed character ``'-'`` rejected in module organisation
   (according to MMM specification ``2.0-B``)
-  Fixed ADP resolution error when the Add-on Processor
   module was only available in the cache
-  Fixed potential build crash depending on the build kit
   classpath order (error was ``This module requires easyant [0.9,+]``)
-  Fixed ``product-java`` broken skeleton

Build Types
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Updated Platform Loader error message when the property
   ``platform-loader.target.platform.dir`` is set to an invalid
   directory
-  Fixed meta build property substitution in
   ``*.modules.list`` files
-  Fixed missing publications for ``README.md`` and
   ``CHANGELOG.md`` files
-  Update skeletons to fetch latest libraries (Wadapps
   Framework ``v1.10.0`` and Junit ``v1.5.0``)
-  Updated ``README.md`` publication to generate MMM usage
   and the list of Foundation Libraries dependencies
-  Added a new build nature for building platform options
   pages (``microej-extension``)
-  Updated Virtual Device builder to speed-up Virtual Device
   boot time (System Applications are now extracted at build time)
-  Fixed Virtual Device Player builder (dependencies were not
   exported into the zip file) and updated ``firmware-singleapp``
   skeleton with missing configurations

Skeletons
^^^^^^^^^

-  Updated ``CHANGELOG.md`` based on ``Keep a Changelog``
   specification (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
-  Updated offline module repository skeleton to fetch in a
   dedicated cache directory under ``${user.dir}/.microej/caches``

-  Updated Virtual Device Builder to include kernel options
   (now options are automatically filled for the application developer
   on Simulator)

MicroEJ Module Manager
""""""""""""""""""""""

^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Added IvyDE resolution from properties defined in
   :guilabel:`Windows` > :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`Ant` > :guilabel:`Runtime` > :guilabel:`Properties`
-  Fixed *Illegal character in path* error that may occur
   when running an Add-on Processor
-  Fixed IvyDE crash when defining an Ant property file
   with Eclipse variables

Build Types
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Kept only latest build types versions (skeletons
   updated)
-  Updated metabuild to execute tests by default for
   private module dependencies
-  Removed remaining build dependencies to JDK (Java code
