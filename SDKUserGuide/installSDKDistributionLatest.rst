Install Latest SDK Distribution
===============================

This section will guide you through the installation process of the latest SDK Distribution ``23.07`` using the step-by-step executable installer.

The SDK Distribution ``23.07`` requires a JDK 11 and thus can only work with an :ref:`Architecture 7.17.0 <changelog-7.17.0>` or higher.
In all other cases, please jump to :ref:`sdk_installation_21_11` section.
See also the :ref:`system-requirements` page for more information on the list of supported environments.

.. note:: 

   Launching the SDK Distribution installer requires administrator privileges and a JDK 11 installed by default on your workstation.
   If you don't have one of them or if you do not want to modify your default settings, please jump to :ref:`sdk_installation_portable` section.

Download SDK Distribution
-------------------------

Download the SDK Distribution ``23.07`` installer for your operating system:

- `Windows (.exe) <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/23.07/MicroEJ-SDK-Installer-Win64-23.07.exe>`__
- `Linux  (.zip) <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/23.07/MicroEJ-SDK-Installer-Linux64-23.07.zip>`__
- `macOS x86_64 - Intel chip (.zip) <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/23.07/MicroEJ-SDK-Installer-MacOS-23.07.zip>`__
- `macOS aarch64 - M1 chip (.zip) <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/23.07/MicroEJ-SDK-Installer-MacOS-A64-23.07.zip>`__ (requires :ref:`Architecture 7.18.0 or higher <changelog-7.18.0>`)

Check JDK Version
-----------------

From the version ``22.06``, the SDK Distribution installer requires a JDK 11 installed by default on your workstation.
If you don't have any JDK installed, see the :ref:`get_jdk` section.

Check the default Java version by running the following command in a new terminal:

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 3
     
   > java -version
     
   openjdk version "11.0.15" 2022-04-19
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.15+10 (build 11.0.15+10)
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.15+10 (build 11.0.15+10, mixed mode)

Now you can proceed with the installation steps.
