Install Latest SDK Distribution
===============================

This section will guide you to install the latest SDK Distribution ``22.06`` using the step-by-step executable installer.

The SDK Distribution ``22.06`` requires a JDK 11 and thus can only work with an :ref:`Architecture <architecture_overview>` ``7.17.0`` or higher.
If you want to evaluate MicroEJ, please refer to the :ref:`getting_started` chapter that will guide you to install a SDK Distribution compatible with the Getting Started page.
See also the :ref:`system-requirements` page for more information on the list of supported environments.

.. note:: 

   Launching the SDK Distribution installer requires administrator privileges and a JDK 11 installed by default on your workstation.
   If you don't have one of them or if you do not want to modify your default settings, please jump to :ref:`sdk_installation_portable` section.

Download SDK Distribution
-------------------------

Download the SDK Distribution ``22.06`` installer for your operating system:

- `Windows (.exe) <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/22.06/MicroEJ-SDK-Installer-Win64-22.06.exe>`__
- `Linux  (.zip) <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/22.06/MicroEJ-SDK-Installer-Linux64-22.06.zip>`__

- `macOS M1 (.zip) <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/22.06/MicroEJ-SDK-Installer-MacOS-A64-22.06.zip>`__

Check JDK Version
-----------------

The SDK Distribution ``22.06`` installer requires a JDK 11 installed by default on your workstation.
If you don't have any JDK installed, see the :ref:`get_jdk` section.

Check the default Java version by running the following command in a new terminal:

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 3
     
   > java -version
     
   openjdk version "11.0.15" 2022-04-19
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.15+10 (build 11.0.15+10)
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.15+10 (build 11.0.15+10, mixed mode)

Now you can proceed with the installation steps.
