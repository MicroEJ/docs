Release Notes
-------------

Starting from SDK version ``5.0.0``, Architectures are distributed separately from the Integrated Development Environment. 
Evaluation Architectures can be downloaded from the `Architectures Repository <https://repository.microej.com/modules/com/microej/architecture/>`_.

The SDK is now packaged into an Eclipse P2 repository (`<https://repository.microej.com/p2/sdk>`_), allowing partial updates and installation on any compatible Eclipse version. 
The historical version (``5``) of MicroEJ is reused for the P2 repository delivery.

MicroEJ Corp. continues to regularly build all-in-one packages, called *Distributions*, including the SDK and dedicated OS installers. 
This distribution has a separate versioning, which follows modern convention: ``[YY].[MM]``.
