Release Notes
-------------

Starting from MicroEJ version ``5.0.0``, MicroEJ Architectures are distributed separately from MicroEJ SDK. MicroEJ Evaluation Architectures can be downloaded from the `Architectures Repository <https://repository.microej.com/modules/com/microej/architecture/>`_.

MicroEJ Studio (resp. SDK) is now packaged into an Eclipse P2 repository (`<https://repository.microej.com/p2/studio>`_), allowing partial updates and installation on any compatible Eclipse version. The historical version (``5``) of MicroEJ is reused for the P2 repository delivery.

MicroEJ continues to regularly build all-in-one packages, called *Distributions*, including an Eclipse base version, various utility plugins, and dedicated OS installers. This distribution has a separate versioning, which follows modern convention: ``[YY].[MM]``.
