Install SDK Distribution 21.11
==============================

This section will guide you to install the SDK Distribution ``21.11`` using the step-by-step executable installer.

The SDK Distribution ``21.11`` requires a JDK 8 and is not available for macOS with M1 chips.
See the :ref:`system-requirements` page for more information on the list of supported environments.

.. note:: 

   Launching the SDK Distribution installer requires administrator privileges and a JDK 8 installed by default on your workstation.
   If you don't have one of them or if you do not want to modify your default settings, please jump to :ref:`sdk_installation_portable` section.

Download SDK Distribution
-------------------------

Download the SDK Distribution ``21.11`` installer for your operating system:

   - `Windows (.exe) <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/21.11/MicroEJ-SDK-Installer-Win64-21.11.exe>`__.

   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_281-b09)
