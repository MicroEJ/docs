Download and Install
====================

The SDK is available for download at https://developer.microej.com/microej-sdk-software-development-kit.
Check the :ref:`system-requirements` page for the list of supported environments.

.. note::

   The SDK Distribution proposed by default for download is the version ``21.11``.
   A newer version, the ``22.06``, is also available in the `SDK Downloads page <https://repository.microej.com/packages/SDK/>`_, 
   but it requires to have an :ref:`Architecture <architecture_overview>` ``7.17`` or more.
   So make sure to use the right Architecture version if you want to use this newer SDK Distribution version.
   
Once downloaded, execute the installer and follow the installation process.
