Training Course
===============

.. _training_multisandbox_applications_imxrt1170_run_demo_sandboxed_apps:

Run the Demo-Sandboxed-Applications
-----------------------------------

The |DEMO_SANDBOXED_APPS_SOURCES_LINK| 
showcases the communication between Sandboxed Applications using the Shared Interfaces.

The following projects are provided:

- :guilabel:`app-power-provider`: application responsible for providing random power values in the system.
- :guilabel:`app-gui`: application responsible for visualizing the power values provided by :guilabel:`app-power-provider`.
- :guilabel:`app-mqtt-publisher`: application responsible for publishing the power values provided by :guilabel:`app-power-provider` to an MQTT topic.
- :guilabel:`sharedinterface`: shared library between apps that defines the shared interface for inter-app communication.

.. warning::
   If you are using your own Multi-Sandbox Executable to run this demo, make sure to configure the
   :ref:`images_heap` size of your Kernel project to the size of your screen.
   The formula to compute the required size is ``SCREEN_WIDTH x SCREEN_HEIGHT x BPP / 2``.
   
   Example with a 1280x720 screen in RGB565 format (16BPP).
   Images Heap size should be:

      - 1280x720x16/2 = 1843200 bytes

Import the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import the project into your IDE:

.. note::
  
   If you are using an IDE other than Android Studio, please have a look at :ref:`sdk_6_import_project` section.

* If you are on the Welcome Screen, click on the :guilabel:`Open` button. Otherwise click either on :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`Open...`.
* Select the :guilabel:`Demo-Sandboxed-Applications` directory located where you downloaded it and click on the :guilabel:`OK` button.

The Gradle project should now be imported in Android Studio, your workspace contains the following project in the :guilabel:`Projects` view: 

   .. figure:: images/multiSandbox/getting-started-demo-sandboxed-applications-project.png
      :alt: Workspace view
      :align: center
      :scale: 70%

Run the Demo-Sandboxed-Applications on the Virtual Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to execute the applications on the Virtual Device, use the Gradle :guilabel:`runOnSimulator`
task:

* Double-click on the :guilabel:`runOnSimulator` task of one the applications (:guilabel:`app-gui`, :guilabel:`app-power-provider`, :guilabel:`app-mqtt-publisher`):

   .. figure:: images/multiSandbox/getting-started-runOnSimulator-demo-sandboxed-applications.png
      :alt: runOnSimulator task
      :align: center

.. note::
  
   Each application is bound to each other. Running one of the applications on the Simulator will run all the applications.

The Virtual Device starts and executes the Demo-Sandboxed-Applications:

.. raw:: html

        <div class="figure align-center">
                <video width="640" height="360" controls="controls" >
                        <source src="https://repository.microej.com/packages/videos/DEV-M0127_VID_Demo-Sandboxed-Applications_NXP_i.MXRT1170_SIM_20241127.webm" type="video/webm">
                </video>
        </div>

Run the Demo on the NXP i.MXRT1170 Evaluation Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Demo-Sandboxed-Applications` applications can be deployed on the NXP i.MXRT1170 Evaluation Kit using the ``localDeploy`` tool.
Each application needs to be deployed individually.

Configure the ``localDeploy`` tool in the project:

* Open the ``gradle.properties`` file located at the root of the :guilabel:`Demo-Sandboxed-Applications` project.
* Get your board's IP address and add it to the ``ipAddress`` field.

Open the Gradle tasks view to deploy the applications on your NXP i.MXRT1170 Evaluation Kit.
Deploy them in the following order:

1. Deploy :guilabel:`app-power-provider`: double-click on the :guilabel:`app-power-provider > Tasks > microej > localDeploy` task.
2. Deploy :guilabel:`app-gui`: double-click on the :guilabel:`app-gui > Tasks > microej > localDeploy` task.
3. Deploy :guilabel:`app-mqtt-publisher`: double-click on the :guilabel:`app-mqtt-publisher > Tasks > microej > localDeploy` task. 

The applications are running on the NXP i.MXRT1170 Evaluation Kit:

.. raw:: html

        <div class="figure align-center">
                <video width="640" height="360" controls="controls" >
                        <source src="https://repository.microej.com/packages/videos/DEV-M0127_VID_Demo-Sandboxed-Applications_NXP_i.MXRT1170_EMB_20241127.webm" type="video/webm">
                </video>
        </div>

Subscribe to the MQTT Topic to Get the Power Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :guilabel:`app-mqtt-publisher` publishes the power values
to a public MQTT Broker: ``test.mosquitto.org``.

The MQTT topic is randomly generated at each application startup.
It can be seen in the console logs:

   .. figure:: images/multiSandbox/getting-started-demo-sandboxed-applications-mqtt-topic.png
      :alt: MQTT topic
      :align: center
      :scale: 70%

Use an MQTT client to subscribe to the topic, for example, using Docker:

.. code-block::

   docker run -it --rm eclipse-mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -p 1883 -q 1 -t microej/demo/sandbox/power_[YOUR_TOPIC_ID]

Every time a power value is published, it can be seen in the MQTT client console:

   .. figure:: images/multiSandbox/getting-started-demo-sandboxed-applications-mqtt-subscribe.png
      :alt: MQTT topic
      :align: center
      :scale: 70%


Managing Applications Lifecycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Multi-Sandbox Executable provides a web server
to interact with the applications. Either through a Web UI or an HTTP API.
This server listens on port ``4001`` by default.

The Server URL can be seen in the console logs:

   .. figure:: images/multiSandbox/getting-started-hokapp-ip.png
      :alt: MQTT topic
      :align: center
      :scale: 70%

Open the URL in a web browser, the installed applications can be seen. 
They can be ``Started / Stopped / Uninstalled``:

Run the Sandboxed Application on the Virtual Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MicroEJ provides `ready to use kernels on the Developer Repository <https://forge.microej.com/ui/repos/tree/General/microej-developer-repository-release/com/microej/kernel>`__.

The :guilabel:`MyApplication` project needs to be configured to use a kernel:

- Open the ``build.gradle.kts`` file of the :guilabel:`MyApplication` project.
- Add the dependency to the NXP i.MXRT1170 kernel: |GREEN_KERNEL_DEPENDENCY|

.. note::
   To use your own Kernel, refer to the
   procedure described in :ref:`sdk_6_getting_started_rt1170_kernel_green_run_application`.

In order to execute the :guilabel:`MyApplication` project on the Virtual Device, the SDK provides the Gradle :guilabel:`runOnSimulator` task. 

.. note::
  
   If you are using an IDE other than IntelliJ IDEA, please have a look at :ref:`sdk_6_run_on_simulator` section.

* Double-click on the :guilabel:`runOnSimulator` task in the Gradle tasks view. It may take a few seconds to start:

   .. figure:: images/multiSandbox/getting-started-runOnSimulator.png
      :alt: runOnSimulator task

      import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
      import okhttp3.Request
      import okhttp3.RequestBody.Companion.asRequestBody
      import java.util.*

- Paste the following code at the end of the file:

   .. code-block:: kotlin

      val buildFeatureTask = tasks.withType(BuildFeatureTask::class).named("buildFeature")
      tasks.register("localDeploy") {
      dependsOn("buildFeature")
      group = "microej"

      // Adjust the following variables to your needs
      val boardIP = "<Board IP Address>" // board ip address
      val boardPort = 4001 // AppConnect port
      val force = true // overwrote existing app with same name
      val start = true // start app after install
      // Note: if your metadata (feature.kf) is part of '/src/main/resources', modify this path accordingly
      val featureKFFilePath = "generated/microej-app-wrapper/feature-resources/feature.kf"

      doLast {
         val applicationFOFile = buildFeatureTask.get().featureFile.get().asFile
         val properties = Properties()
         project.layout.buildDirectory.file(featureKFFilePath).get().asFile.inputStream().use(properties::load)
         val appName = properties.getProperty("name") ?: error("App name not found in $featureKFFilePath")
         val appVersion = properties.getProperty("version") ?: error("App version not found in $featureKFFilePath")

         println("Deploying app $appName $appVersion to board at $boardIP:$boardPort")
         val url = "http://$boardIP:$boardPort/api/app/install?force=$force&start=$start&name=$appName"
         val client = OkHttpClient()
         val multipartBody = MultipartBody.Builder().setType(MultipartBody.FORM) //
            .addFormDataPart(
            "binary",
            applicationFOFile.name,
            applicationFOFile.asRequestBody("application/octet-stream".toMediaType())
            )//
            .build()
         val request = Request.Builder().url(url).post(multipartBody).build()
         client.newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
            if (response.isSuccessful) {
            println("Deployment Successful! Response Code: ${response.code}")
            println("App info: ${response.body?.string()}")
            } else {
            System.err.println("Deployment Failed. Response Code: ${response.code}")
            System.err.println("Cause: ${response.body?.string()}")
            }
         }
      }
      }

      buildscript {
      repositories {
         maven {
            name = "mavenCentral"
            url = uri("https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/")
