VEE Port Programming Practices
==============================

Description
-----------

This page gives a collection of recommended practices that is essential when porting VEE to new hardware and existing embedded software stacks.

Intended Audience
-----------------

This training is designed for embedded developers who want to enhance the quality and security of their C code.

Prerequisites
-------------

To get the most out of this training, participants should have a good knowledge of the C programming language and Board Support Package (BSP) development.

Recommended Practices
---------------------

Embedded software presents several challenges, like traditional software but with the added pressure due to resource constraints.
However, many common issues can be mitigated by following security rules and design principles. MicroEJ already follows certain design principles,
for your own VEE Port development, it is recommended to read the following links from recognized sources:
