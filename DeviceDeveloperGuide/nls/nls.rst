Native Language Support
=======================


Principle
=========

The NLS library facilitates internationalization. It provides support to
manipulate messages and translate them into different languages.

Each message for which there will be an alternative translation is given
a logical name (the *message name* ), and the set of messages is itself
identified by a name, called the *header*.

Each language for which message translations exist is identified by a
string called the *locale*. The format of the locale string is not
restricted, but by convention it is the concatenation of a language code
and a country code:

-  The language code is a lowercase, two-letter code as defined by
   ISO-639.

-  The country code is an uppercase, two-letter code as defined by
   ISO-3166.

Therefore, the required message string is obtained by specifying the
*header*, the *locale* and the *message name*.

The NLS data is defined using a combination of interfaces and text
files. The message strings are pre-processed into immutable objects,
which are available to the NLS library at runtime.


Functional Description

   Native Language Support Process

The header and message names are specified by an interface. The name of
the interface is the *header*. It defines a constant
(``public static final int``) for each message. The name of the field is
the *message name*. The values of the fields must form a contiguous
range of integers starting at 1. Here is an example:

.. code:: java

   package com.is2t.appnotes.nls;

   public interface HelloWorld {

       public static final int HELLO_WORLD = 1;

   }

The application can define multiple headers, each specified by a
separate interface.

For each locale, a properties file is defined that will translate all
messages and define the language-printable name ( ``DISPLAY_NAME`` ).
Make sure that:

-  The file name matches ``[header]_[locale].nls``.

-  The message keys match (case sensitive) the constants defined in the
   interface.

An example of English NLS file, ``helloworld_en_US.nls``:

.. code:: properties

   DISPLAY_NAME=English
   HELLO_WORLD=Hello world!

To be available at runtime, the list of messages must be defined in a
file that contains the list of the fully-qualified names of the
interfaces for the messages set. For example:

::

   com.is2t.appnotes.nls.HelloWorld

This file must then be referenced in the launcher. The messages will be
pre-processed into immutable files.

The use of these messages (converted into immutables) is allowed by
creating a ``BasicImmutablesNLS`` instance that passes the lowercased
``header`` name as an argument:

.. code:: java

   NLS nls = new BasicImmutablesNLS("helloworld");

The messages can then be referenced by using the ``NLS.getMessage(int)``
method passing a message constant as an argument:

.. code:: java

   String message = nls.getMessage(HelloWorld.HELLO_WORLD);

The current locale can be changed using the
``NLS.setCurrentLocale(String)`` method passing the string representing
the locale as an argument:

.. code:: java

   nls.setCurrentLocale("en_US");

The available locales list can be retrieved with the
``NLS.getAvailableLocales()`` method:

.. code:: java

   String[] locales = nls.getAvailableLocales();


Dependencies

No dependency.


Installation
============

The NLS foundation library is a built-in libray.


Use
===

A classpath variable named ``NLS-2.0`` is available.

This library provides a set of options. Refer to the chapter
`??? <#workbenchLaunchOptions>`__ which lists all available options.
