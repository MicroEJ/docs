Limitations
===========

In addition to general `??? <#limitations>`__:

-  The maximum application code size (classes and methods) cannot exceed
   ``256KB``. This does not include application resources, immutable
   objects and internal strings which are not limited.

-  The option ``SOAR > Debug > Embed all type names`` has no effect.
   Only the fully qualified names of types marked as required types are
   embedded.
