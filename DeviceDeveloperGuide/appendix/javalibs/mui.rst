Error Messages
--------------

When an exception is thrown by the implementation of the MicroUI API,
the exception ``MicroUIException`` with the error message

``MicroUI:E=<messageId>``

is issued, where the meaning of ``<messageId>`` is defined in
:ref:`Table "MicroUI Error Messages" <table_mui-error-msgs>`.

   |             | ``paint`` methods).                                    |

   |             | opening the new image, or increase the number of       |

Some other exceptions can be thrown by the MicroUI framework in addition
to the generic ``MicroUIException`` (see previous chapter).

   +======================+========================================================+
   | OutOfEventsException | This exception is thrown when the pump of the internal |
   |                      | thread ``DisplayPump`` is full. In this case, no more  |
   |                      | event (such as ``repaint``, input events etc.) can be  |
   |                      | added into it.                                         |
   |                      |                                                        |
   |                      | Most of time this error occurs when:                   |
   |                      |                                                        |
   |                      | -  There is a user thread which performs too many      |
   |                      |    calls to the method ``paint`` without waiting for   |
   |                      |    the end of the previous drawing.                    |
   |                      |                                                        |
   |                      | -  Too many input events are pushed from an input      |
   |                      |    driver to the display pump (for example some touch  |
   |                      |    events).                                            |
