Appendix E: Application Launch Options
======================================

To run a MicroEJ application on a platform, a MicroEJ launcher is
required. This launcher allows to specify the platform to use, the
execution kind, fix some options etc. The MicroEJ launcher proposes some
several options to customize the platform: some options for each
foundation library, some specific options for the embedded target or for
the simulator etc. This chapter describes all available options in the
MicroEJ launcher. According the targeted platform, some options may be
absent or different (default value etc.).
