LLEXT_RES: External Resources Loader
====================================

Principle
---------

This LLAPI allows to use the External Resource Loader. When installed,
the External Resource Loader is notified when the MicroEJ core engine is
not able to find a resource (an image, a file etc.) in the resources
area linked with the MicroEJ core engine.

When a resource is not available, the MicroEJ core engine invokes the
External Resource Loader in order to load an unknown resource. The
External Resource Loader uses the LLAPI EXT_RES to let the BSP loads or
not the expected resource. The implementation has to be able to load
several files in parallel.

Naming Convention
-----------------

The Low Level API, the ``LLEXT_RES`` API, relies on functions that need
to be implemented. The naming convention for such functions is that
their names match the ``LLEXT_RES_IMPL_*`` pattern. Â 

Header Files
------------

One header file is provided:

-  LLEXT_RES_impl.h

   Defines the set of functions that the BSP must implement to load some
   external resources.
