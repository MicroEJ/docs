Installation
============

LEDs is a sub-part of MicroUI library. When the MicroUI module is
installed, the LEDs module must be installed in order to be able to
connect physical LEDs with PLATFORM. If not installed, the *stub* module
will be used.

In the platform configuration file, check ``GROUP.UI`` >
``MODULE.LEDS.PNAME`` to install LEDs.
