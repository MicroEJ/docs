Installation
============

LEDs is a sub-part of MicroUI library. When the MicroUI module is
installed, the LEDs module must be installed in order to be able to
connect physical LEDs with MicroEJ Platform. If not installed, the
*stub* module will be used.

In the platform configuration file, check ``UI`` > ``LEDs`` to install
LEDs.
