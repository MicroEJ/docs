Principle
=========

The Inputs module contains the C part of the MicroUI implementation
which managesÂ input devices. This module is composed of two elements:

-  the C part of MicroUI input API (a built-in C archive)

-  an implementation of a low level API for the input devices (LLINPUT)
   that must be provided by the BSP (see `??? <#LLINPUT-API-SECTION>`__)
