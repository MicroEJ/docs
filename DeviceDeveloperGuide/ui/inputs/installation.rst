Installation
============

Inputs is a sub-part of the MicroUI library. When the MicroUI module is
installed, the Inputs module must be installed in order to be able to
connect physical input devices with MicroEJ Platform. If not installed,
the *stub* module will be used. In the platform configuration file,
check ``UI`` > ``Inputs`` to install Inputs.
