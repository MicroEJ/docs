External Resources
==================

The Font Generator manages two configuration files when the External
Resources Loader is enabled. The first configuration file lists the
fonts which will be stored as internal resources with the MicroEJ
application. The second file lists the fonts the Font Generator must
convert and store in the External Resource Loader output directory. It
is the BSP's responsibility to load the converted fonts into an external
memory.
