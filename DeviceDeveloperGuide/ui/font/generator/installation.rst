Installation
============

The Font Generator module is an additional tool for MicroUI library.
When the MicroUI module is installed, install this module in order to be
able to embed some additional fonts with the MicroEJ application.

If the module is not installed, the platform user will not be able to
embed a new font with his/her MicroEJ application. He/she will be only
able to use the system fonts specified during the MicroUI initialization
step (see `??? <#section_static_init>`__).

In the platform configuration file, check ``UI`` > ``Font Generator`` to
install the Font Generator module.
