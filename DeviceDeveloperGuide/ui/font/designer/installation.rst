Installation
============

The Font Designer module is already installed in the MicroEJ
environment. The module is optional for the platform, and allows the
platform user to create new fonts.

.. note::

   When the platform user already has a MicroEJ environment which
   provides the Font Designer module, he/she will able to create a new
   font even if the platform does not provide the Font Designer module.

In the platform configuration file, check ``GROUP.UI`` >
``MODULE.FONTDESIGNER.PNAME`` to install the Font Designer module.
