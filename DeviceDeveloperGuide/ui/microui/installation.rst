Installation
============

The MicroUI library is an additional module. In the platform
configuration file, check ``UI`` > ``MicroUI`` to install the library.
When checked, the XML file ``microui`` > ``microui.xml`` is required
during platform creation in order to configure the module. This
configuration step is used to extend the MicroUI library. Refer to the
chapter `??? <#section_static_init>`__ for more information about the
MicroUI Initialization step.
