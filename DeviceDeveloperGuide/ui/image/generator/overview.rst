Principle
=========

The Image Generator module is an off-board tool that generates image
data that is ready to be displayed without needing additional runtime
memory. The two main advantages of this module are:

-  A pre-generated image is already encoded in the format known by the
   display stack. The image loading is very fast and does not require
   any RAM.

-  No extra support is needed (no runtime decoder).
