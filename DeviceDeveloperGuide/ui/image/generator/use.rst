The MicroUI Image APIs are available in the class
``ej.microui.display.Image``. There are no specific APIs that use a
pre-generated image. When an image has been pre-processed, the MicroUI
Image APIs ``createImage*`` will load the image.

Refer to the chapter `??? <#workbenchLaunchOptions>`__ (``Libraries`` >
``MicroUI`` > ``Image``) for more information about specifying the image
configuration file.
