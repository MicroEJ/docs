Installation
============

The Image Generator is an additional module for the MicroUI library.
When the MicroUI module is installed, also install this module in order
to be able to target pre-generated images.

In the platform configuration file, check ``UI`` > ``Image Generator``
to install the Image Generator module. When checked, the properties file
``imageGenerator`` > ``imageGenerator.properties`` is required during
platform creation to configure the module, only when the LCD pixel
representation is not standard (see `??? <#display_pixel_structure>`__).
This configuration step is used to identify the extension class name
(see `??? <#section_image_extension>`__).
