External Resources
==================

The Image Generator manages two configuration files when the External
Resources Loader is enabled. The first configuration file lists the
images which will be stored as internal resources with the MicroEJ
application. The second file lists the images the Image Generator must
convert and store in the External Resource Loader output directory. It
is the BSP's responsibility to load the converted images into an
external memory.
