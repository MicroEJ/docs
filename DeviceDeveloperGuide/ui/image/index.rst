The Image Engine is composed of:

-  The "Image Engine Core" module which is able to load and drawing
   simultaneously some pre-generated images and some dynamic images.

-  An "Image Generator" module, for converting standard image formats
   into the display image format before runtime (pre-generated images).

-  A set of "Image Decoder" modules, for converting standard image
   formats into the display image format at runtime. Each Image Decoder
   is an additional module of the main module "Image Engine".
