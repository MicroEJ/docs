Principle
=========

The Image Engine provides runtime decoders which allow the dynamic
loading of images without using the Image Generator (see
`??? <#section_image_generator>`__). The two main advantages are:

-  The original image is embedded as a resource with the MicroEJ
   application.

-  The original image size in bytes is often smaller than a
   pre-generated image (especially in PNG mode).
