Principle
=========

The Display module contains the C part of the MicroUI implementation
which managesÂ graphical displays. This module is composed of two
elements:

-  the C part of MicroUI Display API (a built-in C archive)

-  an implementation of a low level API for the displays (LLDISPLAY)
   that the BSP must provide (see `??? <#LLDISPLAY-API-SECTION>`__)
