Firmware Linker
===============

A MicroEJ tool is available to link Features as Installed Features
within the executable application. The tool name is Firmware Linker. It
takes as input the executable application file and the Feature binary
code into which to be linked. It outputs a new executable application
file, including the Installed Feature. This tool can be used to append
multiple Features, by setting as the input file the output file of the
previous pass.
