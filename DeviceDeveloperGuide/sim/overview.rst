Principle
=========

The PLATFORM provides an accurate SIMJPF that runs on workstations.
Applications execute in an almost identical manner on both the
workstation and on target devices. The SIMJPF features IO simulation,
JDWP debug coupled with Eclipse, accurate Java heap dump, and an
accurate Java scheduling policy (the same as the embedded one).  [1]_

   Only the execution speed is not accurate. The simulator speed can be
   set to match the average EMBJPF speed in order to adapt the simulator
   speed to the desktop speed.
