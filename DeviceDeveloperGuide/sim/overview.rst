Principle
=========

The MicroEJ Platform provides an accurate MicroEJ simulator that runs on
workstations. Applications execute in an almost identical manner on both
the workstation and on target devices. The MicroEJ simulator features IO
simulation, JDWP debug coupled with Eclipse, accurate Java heap dump,
and an accurate Java scheduling policy (the same as the embedded one).

   Only the execution speed is not accurate. The simulator speed can be
   set to match the average MicroEJ platform speed in order to adapt the
   simulator speed to the desktop speed.
