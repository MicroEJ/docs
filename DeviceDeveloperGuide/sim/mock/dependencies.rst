Dependencies
============

The MicroEJ platform architecture provides some APIs (HIL APIs) to
develop a mock that will be ready to be used against the simulator. The
classpath variable that allows you to access to the HIL Engine API is
``HILENGINE-2.0.1``. MicroEJ projects that build mocks should put that
library on their build path.
