Installation
============

The mock creator is responsible for building the mock jar file using
his/her own method (Eclipse build, ``javac``, etc.).

Once built, the jar file must be put in this specific platform
configuration project folder in order to be included during the platform
creation : ``dropins/mocks/dropins/``.
