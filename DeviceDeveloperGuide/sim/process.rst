Functional Description
======================

In order to simulate external stimuli that come from the native world
(that is, "the C world"), the SIMJPF has a Hardware In the Loop
interface, HIL, which performs the simulation of Java-to-C calls. All
Java-to-C calls are rerouted to an HIL engine. Indeed HIL is a
replacement for the [SNI] interface.

The "simulated C world" is made of mocks that simulate native code (such
as drivers and any other kind of C libraries), so that the MicroEJ
application can behave the same as the device using the EMBJPF.

The SIMJPF and the HIL are two processes that run in parallel: Â the
communication between them is through a socket connection. Mocks run
inside the process that runs the HIL engine.
