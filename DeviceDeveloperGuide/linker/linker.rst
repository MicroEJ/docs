MicroEJ Linker
==============


Overview
========

MicroEJ Linker is a standard linker that is compliant with the
Executable and Linkable File format (ELF).

MicroEJ Linker takes one or several relocatable binary files and
generates an image representation using a description file. The process
of extracting binary code, positioning blocks and resolving symbols is
called linking.

Relocatable object files are generated by SOAR and third-party
compilers. An archive file is a container of Relocatable object files.

The description file is called a Linker Specific Configuration file
(lsc). It describes what shall be embedded, and how those things shall
be organized in the program image. The linker outputs :

-  An ELF executable file that contains the image and potential debug
   sections. This file can be directly used by debuggers or programming
   tools. It may also be converted into a another format (Intel\* hex,
   Motorola\* s19, rawBinary, etc.) using external tools, such as
   standard GNU binutils toolchain (objcopy, objdump, etc.).

-  A map file, in XML format, which can be viewed as a database of what
   has been embedded and resolved by the linker. It can be easily
   processed to get a sort of all sizes, call graphs, statistics, etc.

-  The linker is composed with one or more library loaders, according to
   the platform's configuration.


ELF Overview
============

An ELF relocatable file is split into several sections:

-  allocation sections representing a part of the program

-  control sections describing the binary sections (relocation sections,
   symbol tables, debug sections, etc.)

An allocation section can hold some image binary bytes (assembler
instructions and raw data) or can refer to an interval of memory which
makes sense only at runtime (statics, main stack, heap, etc.). An
allocation section is an atomic block and cannot be split. A section has
a name that by convention, represents the kind of data it holds. For
example, ``.text`` sections hold binary instructions, ``.bss`` sections
hold read-write static data, ``.rodata`` hold read-only data, and
``.data`` holds read-write data (initialized static data). The name is
used in the .lsc file to organize sections.

A symbol is an entity made of a name and a value. A symbol may be
absolute (link-time constant) or relative to a section: Its value is
unknown until MicroEJ Linker has assigned a definitive position to the
target section. A symbol can be local to the relocatable file or global
to the system. All global symbol names should be unique in the system
(the name is the key that connects an unresolved symbol reference to a
symbol definition). A section may need the value of symbols to be fully
resolved: the address of a function called, address of a static
variable, etc.


Linking Process
===============

The linking process can be divided into three main steps:

1. Symbols and sections resolution. Starting from root symbols and root
   sections, the linker embeds all sections targeted by symbols and all
   symbols referred by sections. This process is transitive while new
   symbols and/or sections are found. At the end of this step, the
   linker may stop and output errors (unresolved symbols, duplicate
   symbols, unknown or bad input libraries, etc.)

2. Memory positioning. Sections are laid out in memory ranges according
   to memory layout constraints described by the lsc file. Relocations
   are performed (in other words, symbol values are resolved and section
   contents are modified). At the end of this step, the linker may stop
   and output errors (it could not resolve constraints, such as not
   enough memory, etc.)

3. An output ELF executable file and map file are generated.

A partial map file may be generated at the end of step 2. It provides
useful information to understand why the link phase failed. Symbol
resolution is the process of connecting a global symbol name to its
definition, found in one of the linker input units. The order the units
are passed to the linker may have an impact on symbol resolution. The
rules are :

-  Relocatable object files are loaded without order. Two global symbols
   defined with the same name result in an unrecoverable linker error.

-  Archive files are loaded on demand. When a global symbol must be
   resolved, the linker inspects each archive unit in the order it was
   passed to the linker. When an archive contains a relocatable object
   file that declares the symbol, the object file is extracted and
   loaded. Then the first rule is applied. It is recommended that you
   group object files in archives as much as possible, in order to
   improve load performances. Moreover, archive files are the only way
   to tie with relocatable object files that share the same symbols
   definitions.

-  A symbol name is resolved to a weak symbol if - and only if - no
   global symbol is found with the same name.


Linker Specific Configuration File Specification
================================================

Description
-----------

A Linker Specific Configuration (Lsc) file contains directives to link
input library units. An lsc file is written in an XML dialect, and its
contents can be divided into two principal categories:

-  Symbols and sections definitions.

-  Memory layout definitions.

::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!--
      An example of linker specific configuration file
   -->
   <lsc name="MyAppInFlash">
      <include name="subfile.lscf"/>
      <!--
         Define symbols with arithmetical and logical expressions
      -->
      <defSymbol name="FlashStart" value="0"/>
      <defSymbol name="FlashSize"  value="0x10000"/>
      <defSymbol name="FlashEnd"   value="FlashStart+FlashSize-1"/>
      <!--
         Define FLASH memory interval
      -->
      <defSection name="FLASH" start="FlashStart" size="FlashSize"/>
      
      <!-- 
         Some memory layout directives
      -->
      <memoryLayout ranges ="FLASH">
         <sectionRef name ="*.text"/>
         <sectionRef name ="*.data"/>
      </memoryLayout> 
   </lsc>

File Fragments
--------------

An lsc file can be physically divided into multiple lsc files, which are
called lsc fragments. Lsc fragments may be loaded directly from the
linker path option, or indirectly using the include tag in an lsc file.

Lsc fragments start with the root tag ``lscFragment``. By convention the
lsc fragments file extension is ``.lscf``. From here to the end of the
document, the expression "the lsc file" denotes the result of the union
of all loaded (directly and indirectly loaded) lsc fragments files.

Symbols and Sections
--------------------

A new symbol is defined using ``defSymbol`` tag. A symbol has a name and
an expression value. All symbols defined in the lsc file are global
symbols.

A new section is defined using the ``defSection`` tag. A section may be
used to define a memory interval, or define a chunk of the final image
with the description of the contents of the section.


Memory Layout
-------------

A memory layout contains an ordered set of statements describing what
shall be embedded. Memory positioning can be viewed as moving a cursor
into intervals, appending referenced sections in the order they appear.
A symbol can be defined as a "floating" item: Its value is the value of
the cursor when the symbol definition is encountered. In
`figure_title <#linker-memorylayout-example>`__, the memory layout sets
the ``FLASH`` section. First, all sections named ``.text`` are embedded.
The matching sections are appended in a undefined order. To reference a
specific section, the section shall have a unique name (for example a
reset vector is commonly called ``.reset`` or ``.vector``, etc.). Then,
the floating symbol ``dataStart`` is set to the absolute address of the
virtual cursor right after embedded ``.text`` sections. Finally all
sections named ``.data`` are embedded.

A memory layout can be relocated to a memory interval. The positioning
works in parallel with the layout ranges, as if there were two cursors.
The address of the section (used to resolve symbols) is the address in
the relocated interval. Floating symbols can refer either to the layout
cursor (by default), or to the relocated cursor, using the
``relocation`` attribute. A relocation layout is typically used to embed
data in a program image that will be used at runtime in a read-write
memory. Assuming the program image is programmed in a read only memory,
one of the first jobs at runtime, before starting the main program, is
to copy the data from read-only memory to ``RAM``, because the symbols
targeting the data have been resolved with the address of the sections
in the relocated space. To perform the copy, the program needs both the
start address in ``FLASH`` where the data has been put, and the start
address in ``RAM`` where the data shall be copied.

::

   <memoryLayout ranges="FLASH" relocation="RAM" image="true"> 
      <defSymbol name="DataFlashStart" value="."/>    
      <defSymbol name="DataRamStart" value=" ." relocation="true"/>    	 
      <sectionRef name=".data"/> 
      <defSymbol name="DataFlashLimit" value="."/> 
   </memoryLayout>

.. note::
   the symbol ``DataRamStart`` is defined to the start address where
   ``.data`` sections will be inserted in ``RAM`` memory.


Tags Specification
------------------

Here is the complete syntactical and semantical description of all
available tags of the ``.lsc`` file.

    |                     |                  | Defines a new section. A floating section only holds a declared ``size`` attribute. A fixed section declares at least one of the ``start`` / ``end`` attributes. When this tag is empty, the section is a runtime section, and must define at least one of the ``start``, ``end`` or ``size`` attributes. When this tag is not empty (when it holds a binary description), the section is an image section.                                               |

Expressions
-----------

An attribute expression is a value resulting from the computation of an
arithmetical and logical expression. Supported operators are the same
operators supported in the Java language, and follow Java semantics:

-  Unary operators: ``+ , - , ~ , !``

-  Binary operators: ``+ , - , * , / , % , << , >>> , >> , < , 
   > , <= , >= , == , != , &, | , ^ , && , ||``

-  Ternary operator: ``cond ? ifTrue : ifFalse``

-  Built-in macros:

   -  ``START(name)``: Get the start address of a section or a group of
      sections

   -  ``END(name)``: Get the end address of a section or a group of
      sections

   -  ``SIZE(name)``: Get the size of a section or a group of sections.
      Equivalent to ``END(name)-START(name)``

   -  ``TSTAMPH()``, ``TSTAMPL()``: Get 32 bits linker time stamp
      (high/low part of system time in milliseconds)

   -  ``SUM(name,tag)``: Get the sum of an auto-generated section
      (`??? <#linker-autosections>`__) column. The column is specified
      by its tag name.

An operand is either a sub expression, a constant, or a symbol name.
Constants may be written in decimal (``127``) or hexadecimal form
(``0x7F``). There are no boolean constants. Constant value ``0`` means
``false``, and other constants' values mean ``true``. Examples of use:

::

   value="symbol+3" 
   value="((symbol1*4)-(symbol2*3)"

Note: Ternary expressions can be used to define selective linking
because they are the only expressions that may remain partially
unresolved without generating an error. Example:

::

   <defSymbol name="myFunction" value="condition ? symb1 : symb2"/>

No error will be thrown if the condition is ``true`` and ``symb1`` is
defined, or the condition is ``false`` and ``symb2`` is defined, even if
the other symbol is undefined.


.. _linker-autosections:

Auto-generated Sections
=======================

The MicroEJ Linker allows you to define sections that are automatically
generated with symbol values. This is commonly used to generate tables
whose contents depends on the linked symbols. Symbols eligible to be
embedded in an auto-generated section are of the form:
``prefix_tag_suffix``. An auto-generated section is viewed as a table
composed of lines and columns that organize symbols sharing the same
prefix. On the same column appear symbols that share the same tag. On
the same line appear symbols that share the same suffix. Lines are
sorted in the lexical order of the symbol name. The next line defines a
section which will embed symbols starting with ``zeroinit``. The first
column refers to symbols starting with ``zeroinit_start_``; the second
column refers to symbols starting with ``zeroinit_end_``.

::

   <defSection
           name=".zeroinit" 
           symbolPrefix="zeroInit" 
           symbolTags="start,end"
       />

Consider there are four defined symbols named ``zeroinit_start_xxx``,
``zeroinit_end_xxx``, ``zeroinit_start_yyy`` and ``zeroinit_end_yyy``.
The generated section is of the form:

::

   0x00: zeroinit_start_xxx
   0x04: zeroinit_end_xxx 
   0x08: zeroinit_start_yyy
   0x0C: zeroinit_end_yyy

If there are missing symbols to fill a line of an auto-generated
section, an error is thrown.


Execution
=========

MicroEJ Linker can be invoked through an ANT task. The task is installed
by inserting the following code in an ANT script

::

       <taskdef 
           name="linker"
           classname="com.is2t.linker.GenericLinkerTask" 
           classpath="[LINKER_CLASSPATH]" 
       />

``[LINKER_CLASSPATH]`` is a list of path-separated jar files, including
the linker and all architecture-specific library loaders.

The following code shows a linker ANT task invocation and available
options.

::

       <linker
           doNotLoadAlreadyDefinedSymbol="[true|false]"
           endianness="[little|big|none]"
           generateMapFile="[true|false]"
           ignoreWrongPositioningForEmptySection="[true|false]"
           lsc="[filename]" 
           linkPath="[path1:...pathN]"
           mergeSegmentSections="[true|false]"
           noWarning="[true|false]"
           outputArchitecture="[tag]"
           outputName="[name]" 
           stripDebug="[true|false]" 
           toDir="[outputDir]" 
           verboseLevel="[0...9]"
       > 
               <!-- ELF object & archives files using ANT paths / filesets --> 
               <fileset dir="xxx" includes="*.o"> 
               <fileset file="xxx.a">
               <fileset file="xxx.a">
       
               <!-- Properties that will be reported into .map file --> 
               <property name="myProp" value="myValue"/>        
       </linker>

Map File Interpretor
====================

The map file interpretor is a tool that allows you to read, classify and
display memory information dumped by the linker map file. The map file
interpretor is a graph-oriented tool. It supports graphs of symbols and
allows standard operations on them (union, intersection, subtract,
etc.). It can also dump graphs, compute graph total sizes, list graph
paths, etc.

The map file interpretor uses the standard Java regular expression
syntax.

It is used internally by the graphical `??? <#memorymapanalyzer>`__
tool.

Commands:

-  ::

      createGraph graphName symbolRegExp ... section=regexp

   ::

      createGraph all section=.*          

   Recursively create a graph of symbols from root symbols and sections
   described as regular expressions. For example, to extract the
   complete graph of the application:

-  ::

      createGraphNoRec symbolRegExp ... section=regexp

   The above line is similar to the previous statement, but embeds only
   declared symbols and sections (without recursive connections).

-  ::

      removeGraph graphName

   Removes the graph for memory.

-  ::

      listGraphs

   Lists all the created graphs in memory.

-  ::
