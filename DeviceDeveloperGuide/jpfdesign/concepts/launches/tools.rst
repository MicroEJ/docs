MicroEJ Tool
============

A PLATFORM contains a number of tools to assist with various aspects of
development. Some of these tools are run using MicroEJ Tool
configurations, and created using the Run Configurations dialog of the
workbench. A configuration must be created for the tool before it can be
used.

   MicroEJ Tool Configuration

`figure_title <#build_run_microej_tool>`__ shows a tool configuration
being created. In the figure, the PLATFORM has been selected, but the
selection of which tool to run has not yet been made. That selection is
made in the Execution Settings... box. The Configuration tab then
contains the options relevant to the selected tool.
