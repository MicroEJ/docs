MicroEJ Tool
============

A MicroEJ Platform contains a number of tools to assist with various
aspects of development. Some of these tools are run using MicroEJ Tool
configurations, and created using the Run Configurations dialog of the
workbench. A configuration must be created for the tool before it can be
used.

   MicroEJ Tool Configuration

:ref:`The above figure <fig_tool-launch>` shows a tool configuration
being created. In the figure, the MicroEJ Platform has been selected,
but the selection of which tool to run has not yet been made. That
selection is made in the Execution Settings... box. The Configuration
tab then contains the options relevant to the selected tool.
