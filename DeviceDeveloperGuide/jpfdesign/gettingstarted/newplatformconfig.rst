Create a New PLATFORM Configuration
===================================

The first step is to create a PLATFORM configuration:

-  Select ``File > New > Projectâ€¦``, open MicroEJ category and select
   MicroEJ Platform Project.

-  Click on Next. The Configure Target Architecture page allows to
   select the XPF that contains a minimal PLATFORM and a set of
   compatible modules targeting a processor architecture and a
   compilation toolchain. This environment can be changed later.

   -  Click on Browse... to select one of the installed XPF.

   -  Check the Create from a platform reference implementation box to
      use one of the available implementation. Uncheck it if you want to
      provide your own implementation or if no reference implementation
      is available.

-  Click on Next. The Configure platform properties contains the
   identification of the PLATFORM to create. Most fields are mandatory,
   you should therefore set them. Note that their values can be modified
   later on.

-  Click on Finish. A new project is being created containing a
   ``[name].platform`` file. A platform description editor shall then
   open.
