Groups / Modules Selection
==========================

From the platform description editor, select the Content tab to access
the platform modules selection. Modules can be selected/deselected from
the Modules frame.

Modules are organized into groups. When a group is selected, by default,
all its modules are selected. To view the modules making up a group,
click on the Show/Hide modules icon on the top-right of the frame. This
will let you select/deselect on a per module basis. Note that individual
module selection is not recommended.

The description and contents of an item (group or module) are displayed
beside the list on item selection.

All the checked modules will be installed in the platform.
