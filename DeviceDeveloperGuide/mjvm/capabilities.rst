Capabilities
============

MJVM defines 3 exclusive capabilities:

-  STANDARD: capability to produce a monolithic firmware (default one).

-  MULTIAPP: capability to produce a extensible firmware on which new
   applications can be dynamically installed. See section
   `??? <#core-multiapp>`__.

-  TINY: capability to produce a compacted firmware (optimized for
   size). See section `??? <#core-tiny>`__.

All MJVM capabilities may not be available on all architectures. Refer
to section `??? <#appendix_matrixcapabilities>`__ for more details.
