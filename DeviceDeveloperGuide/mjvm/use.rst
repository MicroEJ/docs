A MicroEJ classpath variable named ``EDC-EDC.VERSION`` is available,
according to the selected foundation core library. This MicroEJ
classpath variable is always required in the build path of a MicroEJ
project; and all others libraries depend on it. This library provides a
set of options. Refer to the chapter `??? <#workbenchLaunchOptions>`__
which lists all available options.

Another classpath variable named ``BON-BON.VERSION`` is available. This
variable must be added to the build path of the MicroEJ application
project in order to access the B-ON library.
