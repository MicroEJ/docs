A MicroEJ classpath variable named ``EDC-1.2`` is available, according
to the selected foundation core library. This MicroEJ classpath variable
is always required in the build path of a MicroEJ project; and all
others libraries depend on it. This library provides a set of options.
Refer to the chapter `??? <#workbenchLaunchOptions>`__ which lists all
available options.

Another classpath variable named ``BON-1.2`` is available. This variable
must be added to the build path of the MicroEJ application project in
order to access the B-ON library.
