Properties
==========

Properties allow the MicroEJ application to be parameterized using the
``System.getProperty`` API. The definition of the properties and their
respective values can be done using files. Each filename of a properties
file must match with ``*.system.properties`` and must be located in the
``properties`` package of the application classpath. These files follow
the MicroEJ property list specification: key/value pairs.

MicroEJ properties can also be defined in the launch configuration. This
can be done by setting the properties in the launcher with a specific
prefix in their name:

-  Properties for both the EMBJPF and the SIMJPF: name starts with
   ``microej.java.property.*``

-  Properties for the SIMJPF: name starts with ``sim.java.property.*``

-  Properties for the EMBJPF: name starts with ``emb.java.property.*``

For example, to define the property ``myProp`` with the value
``theValue``, set the following option in the ``VM arguments`` field of
the ``JRE`` tab of the launch configuration:
-Dmicroej.java.property.myProp=theValue
