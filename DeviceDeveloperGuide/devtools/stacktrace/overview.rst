Principle
=========

Stack Trace Reader is a MicroEJ tool which reads and decodes the MicroEJ
stack traces. When an exception occurs, the MJVM prints the stack trace
on the standard output ``System.out``. The class names and method names
obtained are encoded with a MicroEJ internal format. This internal
format prevents the embedding of all class names and method names in the
flash, in order to save some memory space. The Stack Trace Reader tool
allows you to decode the stack traces by replacing the internal class
names and method names with their real names. It also retrieves the line
number in the MicroEJ application.
