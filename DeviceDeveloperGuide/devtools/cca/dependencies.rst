Dependencies
============

In order to work properly, the Code Coverage Analyzer should input the
.cc files. The .cc files relay the classpath used during the execution
of the simulator to the Code Coverage Analyzer. Therefore the classpath
is considered to be a dependency of the Code Coverage Analyzer.
