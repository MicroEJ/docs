Functional Description
======================

The Net library includes two sub-protocols:

-  UDP: a connectionless-oriented protocol that allows communication
   with the server or client side in a non-reliable way. No handshake
   mechanisms, no guarantee on delivery, and no order in packet sending.

-  TCP: a connection-oriented protocol that allows communication with
   the server or client side in a reliable way. Handshakes mechanism
   used, bytes ordered, and error checking performed upon delivery.
