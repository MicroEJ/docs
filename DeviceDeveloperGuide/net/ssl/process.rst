Functional Description
======================

The SSL/TLS process includes two sub-protocols :

-  Handshake protocol : consists that a server presents its digital
   certificate to the client to authenticate the server's identity. The
   authentication process uses public-key encryption to validate the
   digital certificate and confirm that a server is in fact the server
   it claims to be.

-  Record protocol : after the server authentication, the client and the
   server establish cipher settings to encrypt the information they
   exchange. This provides data confidentiality and integrity.
