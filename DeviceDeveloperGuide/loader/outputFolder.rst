External Resources Folder
=========================

The External Resource Loader module provides an option (MicroEJ launcher
option) to specify a folder for the external resources. This folder has
two roles:

-  It is the output folder used by some extra generators during the
   MicroEJ application build. All output files generated by these tools
   will be copied into this folder. This makes it easier to retrieve the
   exhaustive list of resources to program on the board.

-  This folder is taken into consideration by the simulator in order to
   simulate the availability of these resources. When the resources are
   located in another computer folder, the simulator is not able to load
   them.

If not specified, this folder is created (if it does not already exist)
in the MicroEJ project specified in the MicroEJ launcher. Its name is
``externalResources``.
